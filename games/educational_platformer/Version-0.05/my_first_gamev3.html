<!-- 1/5 12:14-1pm: added functions to make things cleaner, now, need to test again -->
<!-- 1/5 1-1:30pm: collision detection kind of working   -->
<!-- 1/5 1:30-2pm: block stops when approached hor -->
<!-- 1/5 2-4pm: hor and ver dtected; starting to fall through ground -->

<!-- 1/6 3:30-4pm - managed to get collision working (minor minor bugs), now to make object moveable -->

<!-- 1/7 7-7:30am - found three new issues with collision, will check in with them later -->

<!-- 1/11 - spent much time looking/cleaning code; protagonist does not show up; can't press the right key and move  -->
<!-- 1/13 - speed up code; fixed movement; need to create object file -->
<!-- 1/13 - 9:30-10am: thought of a way to link levels; started it  -->

<!-- 1.14 - 8-8930am: debugging code to link  -->
<!-- 1.15 - 3hrs - debugging code to link win conditionsl-->

<!-- 1.19 - 5:00-5:30  -   can double jump inf when collided with objects (FIX); created lvl buttons -->
<!-- 1.20 - 7-730 - can transition screens to diff levels -->
<!-- 11-11:30AM - can move to the left and to the right now pressing buttons -->
<!-- 11---- miseed a log earlier-->

<!--1.22 -- missed a log!! experimented with left/right for a few hours   -->
