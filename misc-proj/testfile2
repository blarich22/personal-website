1. Introduction                                                        [intro]
==============================================================================
I've always wanted to write a guide for a full-sized game. With Pokemon
Black, I was planning on writing a lot of tutorials for my website as I have
with the previous games, so I thought I should write a full guide while I'm
at it.

This guide will show you the way through the game, documenting all items to
find, trainers to battle, and side quests to complete.

I hate when people put useless things before the actual content of the guide, 
so I'll shut up now and get to the goods.

==============================================================================
2. Walkthrough                                                         [pwalk]
==============================================================================

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.1 Nuvema Town                                                        [wnuve]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Similar to previous games in the series, Pokemon Black and White both start
with a quick explanation of the Pokemon world by the new Pokemon professor.
The professor of Unova is Professor Juniper. After choosing your gender and
entering your name, the camera swoops into your house as Professor Juniper
enters.

You will now be inside your house with Cheren. Bianca will soon enter your
room and you will all look at the present on the table. You need to open the
present from Juniper which contains three Pokemon. You get first choice, and
can pick Snivy the Grass Pokemon, Tepig the Fire Pokemon, or Oshawott the
Water Pokemon. The easiest Pokemon to start with is Tepig. It makes the
second gym easy because its evolution is part Fighting, and the third gym
leader can be taken down with it's Fire moves. Oshawott will suffer in the
fourth gym, which features Electric-type Pokemon. Snivy can have a difficult
time in the third gym because it is weak to Bug Pokemon. Regardless of what
Pokemon you pick, you will eventually get a Pokemon that covers its weakness
within a few hours so don't worry. Bianca will then choose the Pokemon that
is weak against your Pokemon, and Cheren will pick the Pokemon that is strong
against your choice.

Once everyone has chosen a Pokemon, Bianca will challenge you to a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Bianca 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   (If you chose Tepig)     Snivy     Lv. 5  Grass
   (If you chose Oshawott)  Tepig     Lv. 5  Fire
   (If you chose Snivy)     Oshawott  Lv. 5  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

This battle should not be very difficult. All three starter Pokemon each have
an attacking move, Tackle, and a defense lowering move, Tail Whip or Leer.
You should be fine if you use Leer/Tail Whip the first turn and then continue
using Tackle until Bianca's Pokemon has fainted.

After the battle with Bianca, the room will be a mess. Cheren will heal your
Pokemon for you and then challenge you to a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cheren
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   (If you chose Oshawott)  Snivy     Lv. 5  Grass
   (If you chose Snivy)     Tepig     Lv. 5  Fire
   (If you chose Tepig)     Oshawott  Lv. 5  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same strategy used for Bianca applies to this battle as well. You win
$500 for each battle.

You are free to walk around once you defeat Cheren, so start by walking
downstairs into a conversation with Cheren, Bianca, and your Mom. Your Mom
says she will clean up the mess and then gives you the Xtransceiver. Head
outside.

Once outside, Bianca will walk south to talk to her parents and you need to
follow her to her house. Enter the southwestern house and Bianca will be
getting yelled at by her father. She will leave and you need to go Professor
Juniper's Lab, which is in the northwestern corner of town. Bianca and Cheren
will be standing in front of the lab. Talk to Cheren and all three of you
will all enter the lab. You will be given a Pokedex and a chance to name your
Pokemon. After Professor Juniper leaves, walk outside for a quick talk with
your Mom and she will give you the Town Map. After everyone is done talking
you can start your adventure by heading to Route 1, which is northeast of the
lab.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.2  Route 1                                                           [wrt01]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You and your two rivals will walk north to Professor Juniper, who will teach
you how to catch a Pokemon and give you 5 Pokeballs. Now you can travel north
through Route 1. Make sure to talk to the dark-haired girl in the grass for a
free Potion. Towards the end of the route you will encounter Cheren and
Bianca again. They will teach you how to use the Xtransceiver by having a
four-way chat with Professor Juniper. Head north to enter Accumula Town.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Wild Pokemon in Route 1:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lillipup  Lv. 2-4  Normal
   Patrat    Lv. 2-4  Normal
   Audino    Lv. 2-4  Normal  (Shaking Grass)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Route 1:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Potion - Talk to the dark-haired girl in the eastern patch of grass.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.3  Accumula Town                                                     [waccu]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The first building you see is the Pokemon Center, where Professor Juniper is
standing. Talk to her and she will teach you everything there is to know
about the Pokemon Center whether you want her to or not. She will show you how
to heal your Pokemon, explain the Pokemon Box system, and show you the
PokeMart. You might want to stock up on as many Potions you can buy, as they
come in handy often.

Now is a good time to save if you haven't already done so. Walk outside once
you're ready and you will hear a commotion west of the Pokemon Center. Try to
walk west towards the crowd and Cheren will eventually stop you. Team Plasma
is speaking some propaganda. After they leave and the screen fades to black,
N will approach you for a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   N
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Purrloin  Lv. 7  Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

This battle should be easy, especially if you're starter is level 10 or
greater. Once you defeat N he will talk briefly and leave. Cheren will talk
to you and head north.

There are a few things you can do in town before you leave, although none of
them are very important. You can get a free Poke Ball from the man on the top
floor of the northwestern house. You can also play a game of grass, fire,
water (rock, paper, scissors) with the girl on the same floor. Finally, you
can visit the northeastern house for a chance to play around with the game's
music. If you talk to either of the musicians, they will jam out to the
town's music with their instrument until you leave town.

Once you're ready, head to the northwestern part of town and walk through the
passageway to Route 2.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Accumula Town:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Poke Ball - The man on the second floor of the northwestern house.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.4  Route 2                                                           [wrt02]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
After a few steps into Route 2, your Mom will give you a call. Afterwards,
she will show up behind you and give you the Running Shoes. These allow you
to travel much faster by holding B as you move. Head into the patch of grass
and you'll find a Potion. You'll eventually run into a Youngster who wants
to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Youngster Jimmy
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat  Lv. 7  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you defeat Youngster, continue walking east until you encounter a Lass.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lass Mali
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Purrloin  Lv. 7  Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After defeating Lass, walk east until you hit some grass and then travel
north where you can face another Youngster.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Youngster Roland
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lillipup  Lv. 7  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk east from the Youngster up the hill to find a Poke Ball and Potion
laying out in the open. Go back down the hill and head north to battle
Bianca.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Bianca
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Lillipup  Lv. 6  Normal
   (If you chose Tepig)     Snivy     Lv. 7  Grass
   (If you chose Oshawott)  Tepig     Lv. 7  Fire
   (If you chose Snivy)     Oshawott  Lv. 7  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you defeat Bianca continue north where you will enter Striaton City.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Wild Pokemon in Route 2:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lillipup  Lv. 4-7  Normal
   Patrat    Lv. 4-7  Normal
   Purrloin  Lv. 4-7  Dark
   Audino    Lv. 4-7  Normal  (Shaking)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Route 2:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Running Shoes - Received from your Mom.
   Potion        - In southern-most grass.
   Potion        - On the hill near the northern exit.
   Poke Ball     - On the hill near the northern exit.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.5  Striaton City                                                     [wstri]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
At the very southern end of Striaton City, you can walk along the west fence
behind the trees to find an X Speed.

If you enter the soutern set of stairs on the eastern-most building, you can
talk to a man that will give you a Great Ball. It is more powerful than a
Poke Ball, and until you can buy Ultra Balls it is your best bet to catch
Pokemon.

If you go outside and walk down the alley between the eastern building you
just left and the trees, you will find a man who gives you a Dusk Ball. The
Dusk Ball is most effective at night and in poorly-lit areas like caves.

The building to the west of the Pokemon Center is a school. There is a boy
with brown hair who wants to quiz you. If you answer the first question with
the top choice and the second question with the bottom choice he will reward
your intelligence with a Full Heal. You will find Cheren, who wants to battle
you, by the chalkboard.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cheren
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   (If you chose Oshawott)  Snivy  Lv. 8  Grass
   (If you chose Snivy)     Tepig  Lv. 8  Fire
   (If you chose Tepig)     Oshawott  Lv. 8  Water
                            Purrloin  Lv. 8  Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you defeat Cheren, he will give you 3 Oran Berries and continue
studying. Held Oran Berries heal 10 HP in battle, or you can use them as an
item just like a Potion. You may want to save the berries for the gym battle
in town.

West of the school is a fountain. South of the fountain, across the bridge,
is another Great Ball.

Before you go to the gym, you should head east of town to the Dreamyard. You
will be given a Pokemon there that will cover your starter Pokemon's weakness
which will help you in the gym battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Striaton City:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   X Speed    - At the Southern end of town between trees and fence.
   Great Ball - In the eastern building, southern stairs, talk to the brown-
                haired man on the bottom floor.
   Dusk Ball  - Talk to the man behind the eastern-most buildings.
   Full Heal  - In the school, talk to the brown-haired kid and take his
                quiz. Answer with the top choice for the first question,
                bottom choice for the second question.
   Oran Berry - Three are received from Cheren after you defeat him in the
                school.
   Great Ball - At the western part of town, south of the fountain.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.6  Dreamyard                                                         [wdrea]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You will first encounter a Lass.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lass Eri
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Purrloin  Lv. 8  Dark
   Purrloin  Lv. 8  Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take notice of the tree that is blocking the doorway. You'll have to come
back here once you have a way to cut down trees. Right after the Lass is a
Youngster.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Youngster Joey
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat    Lv. 7  Normal
   Patrat    Lv. 7  Normal
   Lillipup  Lv. 7  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you beat both trainers, talk to the dark-haired person and you will
receive a monkey Pokemon according to what starter you chose. Just make sure
you have a spare slot in your party, otherwise you'll have to go back to the
Pokemon Center and deposit a Pokemon.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gift Pokemon:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   (If you chose Snivy)     Panpour  Lv. 10  Water
   (If you chose Tepig)     Pansage  Lv. 10  Grass
   (If you chose Oshawott)  Pansear  Lv. 10  Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll have a chance to name it. Now you have a strong Pokemon that will help
you in your upcoming gym battle. You can find an X Defend north near the
orange traffic cone.

That's all there is to do for right now until you can cut down trees, so head
back to Striaton City to take on the first gym.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Dreamyard:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   X Defend - Near the traffic cone.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.7  Striaton City Gym                                                 [wgstr]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Now that you have a well-balanced team, talk to the green-haired guy standing
in the doorway of the gym, the building east of the Pokemon Center. He will
walk into the gym once he's done talking and you should follow. Once you enter
the gym and take a step forward, a man will notice you and give you a Fresh
Water. In fact, he will give you a Fresh Water at every gym in Unova. There
are three panels in front of you, one to signify three Pokemon types: grass,
fire, and water. There is also a curtain blocking you from the next room that
has one of the types on it. You need to step on the panel that the curtain is
weak against. The first curtain has a fire symbol on it, so step on the water
panel to open the curtain. Beyond the curtain is a Waiter to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Waiter Maxwell
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lillipup  Lv. 11  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second curtain has a water symbol on it, so walk onto the grass panel.
Once the curtain opens, there will be a Waitress waiting to battle you.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Waitress Tia
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat    Lv. 10  Normal
   Purrloin  Lv. 11  Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The third and final curtain has a grass symbol on it, so walk onto the fire
panel. Walk up the stairs to meet with Gym Leader Cilan. He will introduce
Gym Leader Chili and Gym Leader Cress. For the first time in a Pokemon game,
there are three gym leaders for a single gym. Luckily, you only need to
defeat one to get the Trio-Badge. The gym leader you battle is the one that
has hair symbolizing the type that your starter is weak against. It is always
a good idea to save before a gym leader battle because their Pokemon are more
powerful than any other Pokemon you have faced yet. A good strategy for this
battle is to use your starter Pokemon (Snivy, Tepig, or Oshawott) to take out
the gym leader's Lillipup, and then send out your elemental monkey (Pansage,
Pansear, or Panpour) to take out the gym leader's elemental monkey.

If you chose Oshawott, you will battle Cilan.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gym Leader Cilan
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lillipup  Lv. 12  Normal
   Pansage   Lv. 14  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you chose Snivy, you will battle Chili.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gym Leader Chili
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lillipup  Lv. 12  Normal
   Pansear   Lv. 14  Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you chose Tepig, you will battle Cress.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gym Leader Cress
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lillipup  Lv. 12  Normal
   Panpour   Lv. 14  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you defeat either Cilan, Chili, or Cress you will be awarded with the
Tri-Badge and TM 83, Work Up. TMs are a little different than they used to
be in previous Pokemon games. TMs used to be a one-time use item, but now
they are unlimited use. This is great because you will most likely find a
move that you want to teach to multiple Pokemon, and it saves you from having
to look for more copies of the same TM. You also now have the ability to use
HM 01 (Cut), which you will get soon, outside of battle.

As you try to walk out of the gym, Fennel will stop you and take you to the
second floor of the eastern house that was previously blocked. She will give
you HM 01 (Cut). It allows you to cut down small trees that previously
blocked your way. Fennel wants you to go to the Dreamyard and find the Dream
Mist from Munna to fix the Game Sync machine.

Now that you can use Cut, you may want to go back to Route 2 and find the
tree that's north of the set of ledges. You can find a Super Potion, which
restores 50 HP, and a Great Ball. Whether or not you decide to go back to
Route 2, head to the Dreamyard again to find the Dream Mist.

                      gym.
   TM 83 (Work Up) - Received from the Gym Leader after defeat.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Now that you have HM 01, teach one of your Pokemon the move Cut. Find the
bush that is blocking the opening in the wall and cut it down by pressing A
while facing it. Once you try to enter the hole in the wall, Bianca will come
and talk to you and then walk ahead a little. Walk past her and you will hear
a noise. Walk up through the doorway and sitting out in the open will be a
Munna, which is the Pokemon Fennel in Striaton was looking for. If you get
close enough, Bianca will step in and the Munna will scurry off. You and
Bianca automatically follow, and then some Team Plasma Grunts show up. The
grunts are abusing the Munna, so you have to put a stop to it by battling
them.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat  Lv. 10  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you defeat him, a female grunt will want to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Purrloin  Lv. 10  Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once she is defeated, there will be some banter and then Ghetsis, the guy
from Karakusa Town, will teleport in. A second Ghetsis teleports, and then he
teleports a third time to show up behind the two grunts. The grunts run off
and Ghetsis teleports away. A Musharna, the evolution of Munna, comes around
the corner. Fennel from Striaton City appears and notices the two Pokemon,
who leave shortly after. It turns out that Musharna was making an illusion of
Ghetsis to save Munna. Musharna and Munna leave the Dream Mist behind. Fennel
snags it and runs back to the lab in Striaton City.

Once Bianca is done talking you can walk west, under the walkway above, to
find a Poke Ball in the grass. A Parlyz Heal can be found by the hole in the
wall near the bottom of the stairs. Walk up the stairs and take a left to
find a Potion. Head right at the top of the stairs to get a Repel, one of the
most useful items in the game because it prevents wild Pokemon encounters for
100 steps.

Whether or not you decide to pick up the stray items lying around, head back
to Striaton City.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Find the eastern-most building in Striaton City and enter at the northern set
of stairs. Go to the second floor and talk to Fennel. She gives you the C-
Gear, which constantly checks for Wireless, Wi-Fi, and Infrared connections
to let you use different features. Wireless lets you access the Entralink and
the Xtransceiver. Wi-Fi gives you access to Game Sync, which syncs your game
with the Pokemon Global Link website. Infrared lets you trade and battle
against other people that are nearby in real life.

Now that the C-Gear let's you access the online features of Pokemon Black and
White, Amanita gives you the Pal Pad. The Pal Pad lets you store other
people's friend codes so you can easily battle and trade with them online.

A quick note before you leave: The C-Gear is always checking for new wireless
networks and other people with Black or White in the vicinity, which uses up
your DS battery. If you don't plan on using the C-Gear, you should turn it
off by tapping the power button in the lower right-hand corner of the bottom
screen. This will extend your DS battery life.

Now that you have the C-Gear, you can make your way to Route 3. It is located
on the west end of Striaton City past the garden area.

2.10 Route 3                                                           [wrt03]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The first thing you'll see in Route 3 is a set of stairs. If you walk up the
stairs, you will see two buildings. The building to the right is the Pokemon
Day Care, where you can drop off your Pokemon for two reasons. One reason is
to breed two compatible Pokemon which results in an egg you can hatch. The
other reason is to have the Pokemon gain a certain amount of experience for
each step you take when it is in the Day Care. The building on the left is a
preschool. You can go inside this building and talk to the person just in
front of the doorway and she will heal your Pokemon so you won't have to walk
all the way back to Striaton City.

West of the preschool is a sand box with a hidden item, but first you must
battle a Nursery Aide. She has a Munna that can put your Pokemon to sleep,
which can be very annoying. It's always good to keep Full Heals and Awakenings
on hand for such an occasion.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Nursery Aide Autumn
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lillipup  Lv. 10  Normal
   Munna     Lv. 10  Psychic
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk over to the sand box. You will find a hidden Ultra Ball if you walk to
the top-left corner of the sand box, take one step right, take two steps
down, and press A. Except for the Master Ball, Ultra Balls are the best non
specialty balls to catch Pokemon. The next trainer to battle is next to
stairs of the slide.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Preschooler Tully
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansage  Lv. 10  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take a ride down the slide if you want. There are two Preschoolers south
of the slide who want to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Preschooler Wendy
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansear  Lv. 10  Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Preschooler Doyle
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Panpour  Lv. 10  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heal up inside the preschool and make your way back down the steps and
west where you will fight your first double battle. If you are unfamiliar
with double battles, it is when each team has two Pokemon active at a time.
The two Pokemon of yours that are chosen are the top two slots in your party.
Make sure you have the two Pokemon you want to battle at the top of your
party by pressing X, selecting the Pokemon option, and switching your choices
to the top of your party.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep walking west and you'll see an item in the patch of grass. Don't get too
excited because Cheren will show up to battle. It shouldn't be a very tough
battle now that you have the elemental monkey that can take down his starter
Pokemon. His starter Pokemon holds an Oran Berry, so when it gets down to
below 33% health, it will replenish 10 HP.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cheren
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   (If you chose Snivy)     Tepig     Lv. 14  Fire
   (If you chose Tepig)     Oshawott  Lv. 14  Water
   (If you chose Oshawott)  Snivy     Lv. 14  Grass
                            Purrloin  Lv. 12  Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, two Plasma Grunts will run past followed by Bianca and a
little girl. Team Plasma stole the girl's Pokemon so you and Cheren need to
get them back. After everyone is done talking, Cheren runs off west to chase
down the Plasma Grunts. You can now get the item ball in the patch of grass,
which contains a Super Potion. If you try to go south, Bianca will stop you.
You can still go back to the preschool to heal you're Pokemon if you need.
Head west when you're ready.

Walk west until you hit a wall and then go north until you see Cheren. If you
talk to him he will ask if you want to go into the cave together to track
down the Plasma Grunts. Say no for now because there is still a trainer to
fight and an item to find if you walk east through the grass. First, you'll
battle a Pokemon Breeder.

   Patrat    Lv. 9  Normal
   Pidove    Lv. 9  Normal/Flying
   Lillipup  Lv. 9  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

She will give you an Oran Berry after you defeat her. Walk south from the
Pokemon Breeder to find a Repel. Hop down the ledge and make your way back to
Cheren. Talk to Cheren and say yes to his question. He will go into the cave
and you need to follow him.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
It is a good time to save right as you enter. When you're ready, walk toward
the two Plasma Grunts which will lead into a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat  Lv. 12  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two more Plasma Grunts will come to battle, but this time it will be a double
battle with you and Cheren on a team. Cheren will use his starter. This
battle shouldn't be hard, but it can be difficult if you are unlucky. You
have no control over Cheren's Pokemon, so if one of the Plasma Grunts'
Patrats use Bide and Cheren decides to attack it, you could be in trouble.
With any luck you will attack a Patrat and then Cheren's Pokemon will finish
it off.

After the battle there will be some talking. The Plasma Grunts will leave and
Cheren will go back to Route 3. You can walk west and make your way around the
rock to the item ball which contains TM 46, Thief. That's all there is to do
here now, so walk back outside to Route 3.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Make your way back to Bianca and the little girl. To thank you, the little
girl will give you three Heal Balls before Bianca takes her back to where she
belongs. The Heal Ball is just like a regular Poke Ball, except it will
completely heal the Pokemon you catch. You can now travel south, where you
will run into a School Kid ready to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   School Kid Al
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Blitzle  Lv. 13  Electric
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the patch of grass east of the School Kid is an Antidote. Keep walking
south and Cheren will come and talk to you. He will warn you about the tall,
dark grass. It can lead to wild double battles. Continue south and you'll run
into another School Kid.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   School Kid Marsha
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Woobat  Lv. 13  Psychic/Flying
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you cross the bridge, keep walking south through the grass to find a
Great Ball. As you cross the bridge you will find another School Kid.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   School Kid Gina
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat    Lv. 12  Normal
   Purrloin  Lv. 12  Dark

You'll find an Awakening once you cross the bridge. Soon after, you will find
another School Kid.

   Pidove      Lv. 12  Normal/Flying

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Walk west a couple of steps and you'll meet up with Cheren. He will walk you
on the tracks to the Pokemon Center and give you 3 Chesto Berries, which wake
up a sleeping Pokemon. After Cheren leaves, you might want to heal your
Pokemon after the long trip through Route 3.

The building west of the Pokemon Center has battle items such as X Defend and
X Attack for sale. These items increase a specific stat for the duration of a
single battle. I've found them to be good to use for battles with gym
leaders. The building west of that has a person that will give a very good
item. Talk to the blue-haired woman. She will ask you to pick one of three
choices and she will give an item based on your choice.

1. Snivy    - Miracle Seed - Powers up Grass-Type moves 20%
2. Oshawott - Mystic Water - Powers up Water-Type moves 20%
3. Tepig    - Charcoal     - Powers up Fire-Type moves 20%

The obvious choice is to pick your starter Pokemon, but you can choose
whatever you want. You could even pick the item that will help out your
elemental monkey if you'd like. Don't worry too much about this decision
because you can get all three of these items throughout the game regardless
of which on you get now.

Each one of the items will power up a Pokemon's moves of the related type by
twenty percent when held. To give a Pokemon an item to hold, press X to bring
up the start menu, choose Pokemon, then select the Pokemon you want to give
an item. The third choice in the dialog that pops up will be "Item", and it
will give the choices "Give" and "Take." Choose Give and then find the item
in your bag that you want the Pokemon to hold. You can always choose Take in
order to get the item back from your Pokemon.

The first building east of the Pokemon Center is closed, but the next house
east has a trade available. Upstairs in this building is a girl who wants to
trade her Petilil for your Cottonee in Black, or her Cottonee for your
Petilil in White. Cottonee can only be caught in Black and Petilil can only
be caught in White, so this is a good way to fill up your Pokedex. Also,
traded Pokemon gain more experience than non-traded Pokemon. You can't yet
catch either Cottonee (Black) or Petilil (White) until you get to the
Pinwheel Forest, but Nacrene City is connected to the forest to the west so
you can go catch one after you defeat this city's gym.

If you go northwest from the Pokemon Center you'll find a Cafe. If it's
Wednesday then it's your lucky day because the waitress in the front will
give you a Soda Pop for talking with her.

The big, gray building north of the Pokemon Center is the Nacrene City Museum
and Gym. N will walk out as your try to enter and he will want to battle you.
N's Tympole can confuse you, but you can just switch out a confused Pokemon
to heal the confusion. Timburr can hit for a lot of damage, so be careful.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   N
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pidove   Lv. 13  Normal/Flying
   Tympole  Lv. 13  Water
   Timburr  Lv. 13  Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you walk into the museum you will see a scientist looking at a skeleton
of a Dragonite. He will show you some of the various exhibits of the museum
before leading you upstairs to the gym. Before you head into the gym, you
will want to go to the Pinwheel Forest to train up your Pokemon and get a TM
of a Fighting-type move which will be super-effective against this gym
leader's Normal-type Pokemon. Make your way outside and head west to go to
Pinwheel Forest.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Nacrene City:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Chesto Berry - Cheren gives you three when you enter the city.
   Soda Pop     - The waitress of the cafe on Wednesdays.

2.14 Outer Pinwheel Forest                                             [wopin]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The first woman you see will give you TM 94, Rock Smash. It is a Fighting-
type move that is super-effective against the Normal-type Pokemon that the
gym leader in Nacrene City uses. The best type of Pokemon to use this attack
is a Fighting-type Pokemon, so let's keep going until we find a patch of
grass to catch one. If you chose Tepig and it has evolved into an Pignite, it
is now a Fire and Fighting-type, so teaching it Rock Smash would be good for
the second gym battle. Keep walking west, and then south to find a woman in
pink who will only battle if you talk to her. She has a Munna at a high
level, so be prepared.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Nurse Shery
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Munna  Lv. 15  Psychic
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Being a nurse, she will heal your Pokemon for you and she will now heal your
Pokemon each time you talk to her. If you walk between the fence and the
trees you will eventually find an Ether. South of the Nurse is a female
Preschooler.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Preschooler Juliet
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cottonee  Lv. 13  Grass
   Petilil   Lv. 13  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, a male Preschooler is walking along the tracks.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Preschooler Homer
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Roggenrola  Lv. 14  Rock
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep walking down the tracks to find a Great Ball. Continue south through the
grass and you will find a Youngster.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Youngster Keita
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Tympole  Lv. 13  Water
   Tympole  Lv. 13  Water
   Tympole  Lv. 13  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

South of him is an Antidote. If you walk southwest from the Antidote, you
will find a Super Potion past some dark grass. Head east to find another
Youngster.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Youngster Zachary
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Venipede  Lv. 14  Bug
   Lillipup  Lv. 14  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Past the Youngster is a huge set of stairs where a Black Belt is waiting to
battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Black Belt Kentaro
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Timburr  Lv. 16  Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, there is a Battle Girl spinning around looking for a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Battle Girl Lee
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Timburr  Lv. 16  Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you press A at the big rock here, you will get a Star Piece which can be
sold for a lot of money at a Poke Mart. You can get a Star Piece here once
every day. Walk down the second set of stairs and there will be a Net Ball. It
works best on Water and Bug Pokemon, otherwise it is just like a regular Poke
Ball.

If you didn't start with Tepig, you most likely don't have a Fighting Pokemon
yet. The grass around here has three different Fighting Pokemon to catch:
Timburr, Throh, and Sawk. Throh can be found normally in White, and only in
shaking grass in Black. Sawk can be found normally in Black, and only in
shaking grass in White. The best Pokemon to catch and train for the second
gym battle is Sawk, because it has the highest attack stat and pretty good
speed. If you teach it Rock Smash with the TM 94 you got earlier, it will do
a lot of damage to Normal-type Pokemon in the second gym. When you're ready
for the second Gym head back to Nacrene City.

                  standing in the very bottom-right corner of the puddle take
                  two steps up, one step left, and press A. (Hidden)

2.15 Nacrene City Gym                                                  [wgnac]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Once you find your way back to the gym, the white-haired guy will give you a
Fresh Water. Make sure to teach Rock Smash to one of your Pokemon. It is super
effective against Normal-type Pokemon and many of the Pokemon in your team
should be able to learn it. There is a School Kid up front wanting to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: Always answer yes to the questions in this gym.

There are a total of five bookshelves in the middle of this gym with stools
in front of them. Two of them have trainers studying at them. First, go to
the bottom-left bookshelf and inspect it. Answer yes to read the book.
Now go up to the middle-left bookshelf and inspect it. Answer yes to read the
book. You will see the trainer at the top-left bookshelf turn around. Walk up
to her and answer yes to her question to start a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scientist Satomi
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Herdier  Lv. 17  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you defeat her, the Scientist moves away from the bookshelf. Inspect it
and answer yes to read the book. Now go to the bottom-right bookshelf and
inspect it, answering yes to read it. Finally, go up to the middle right
bookshelf, talk to the girl, answer yes to her question, and she will battle
you.

The School Kid moves away from the bookshelf. Inspect the bookshelf and you
will find a switch. Once the switch is activated, the bookshelf will move out
of the way, revealing a passageway downstairs. Walk downstairs and you will
find Lenora, the gym leader of Nacrene City. She specializes in Normal-type
Pokemon, so hopefully you came prepared with a Fighting-type Pokemon. Having
a good Fighting-type Pokemon like Sawk around level 20 makes this gym battle
much more managable. Lenora's Herdier has the Intimidate ability, which
decreases its opponent's Attack stat when Herdier is sent out. You may want
to send out a dummy Pokemon first just so a more useful Pokemon doesn't have
its Attack stat decreased. Her Watchog has the move Retaliate, which will
do a lot of damage if it is used right after one of its teammates is knocked
out. You may want to send out a dummy Pokemon after you knock out Herdier to
take the massive damage if Watchog uses Retaliate.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Herdier  Lv. 18  Normal
   Watchog  Lv. 20  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you defeat Lenora, she will give you the Basic Badge and TM 67,
Retaliate. The scientist that gave you the tour of the museum will barge in
and say Team Plasma is trying to steal something. Lenora dashes out and you
need to go to the museum. When you get there, Lenora and some Team Plasma
members will be talking and before you know it, a huge cloud of smoke pops up
and the Dragon Skull is gone. Lenora rushes outside to catch them and you need
to follow her. When you go outside it seems like it's too late because Lenora
is looking around puzzled, not knowing which way they went. Burgh, the gym
leader of Castelia City, walks up and asks what's happening. Bianca and Cheren
arrive too. After some talking, both of the gym leaders walk off in separate
directions. Bianca gives you the Dowsing Machine, otherwise known as the Item
Finder. It can help you find hidden items. Bianca and Cheren will walk off to
explore the museum. You may want to heal your Pokemon and save. Once you're
ready, head west to the Pinwheel Forest.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Nacrene City Gym:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Fresh Water - Received from the white-haired man at the beginning of the
                 gym.
   TM 67 (Retaliate) - Received from Lenora after she is defeated.

2.16 Pinwheel Forest                                                   [wpinw]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
It is smart to stock up on Antidotes before you enter Pinwheel Forest because
there are a lot of Pokemon that have moves and abilities that can inflict
poison. As you head to the Pinwheel Forest, you'll run into Burgh. He will go
into the forest. When you enter, you will see him again. Approach him and he
will explain that there are two paths: west and north. He takes the north
path, so you can take the west path. The first trainers you meet are twins
ready for a double battle.

Walk south to battle a Plasma Grunt. He has a new Pokemon you haven't seen
before, Sandile. It has Intimidate, which will decrease your opening
Pokemon's attack. It also has Torment, which prevents you from using the same
attack two turns in a row.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sandile  Lv. 16  Ground/Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember the girl that wanted to trade Pokemon back in Nacrene City? You can
catch the Pokemon she wanted in Pinwheel Forest. If you catch a Cottonee in
Black or a Petilil in White, just go back to the building east of the Pokemon
Center in Nacrene City to trade for the other. It will hold a Cheri Berry,
which heals paralysis. Traded Pokemon gain more experience at the end of
battles than non-traded Pokemon, so it will gain levels faster than normal.

Walk west to find another Plasma Grunt. Before fighting her, walk south
through the grass and west to find a Big Root. The Big Root increases
absorbed HP from moves like Mega Drain and Leech Seed by 30 percent, which is
great for a lot of Grass Pokemon. Make your way back to the grunt to battle
her.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt

There is a Pokemon Ranger in a red hat waiting in the grass.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Forrest
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Herdier  Lv. 18  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He will give a Chesto Berry after defeating him. A held Chesto Berry will
cure sleep in battle. A Super Potion is off to the west.

West of the Super Potion is a Youngster. His Venipede has the Poison Point
ability, which has a 30 percent chance of poisoning your Pokemon if Venipede
is hit with a physical attack.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Youngster Nicholas
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Venipede  Lv. 16  Bug/Poison
   Timburr   Lv. 16  Fighting

Keep following the path and you find a tree stump with an Antidote in it.
There are two green bumps on the ground, the northern bump has a Pokemon
Ranger hiding in it.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Audra
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansage  Lv. 18  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

She will give you a Chesto Berry after defeating her. Walk through the
hollowed-out log and under the slanted log. Keep following the path and the
first green bump on the ground hides another Pokemon Ranger.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Irene
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Panpour  Lv. 18  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

She will give you a Pecha Berry. A held Pecha Berry will cure a poisoned
Pokemon in battle. Walk up the slanted log and there will be a Plasma Grunt
ready to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat  Lv. 16  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk through the hollowed-out log to the north and follow the path until you
find a stump with a Parlyz Heal inside. The eastern-most green bump on the
ground has a Pokemon Ranger waiting to pounce.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Miguel
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansear  Lv. 18  Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Pokemon Ranger will give you a Pecha Berry after the battle. Down the
stairs and through the grass is TM 86, Grass Knot, which is a useful Grass
type move. The amount of damage that Grass Knot does is related to the weight
of the Pokemon being attacked. The heavier the attacked Pokemon is, the more
damage Grass Knot does. Head back to the Pokemon Ranger and walk through the
log. The final Team Plasma member in Pinwheel Forest is waiting for you.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat   Lv. 14  Normal
   Sandile  Lv. 14  Ground/Dark
   Patrat   Lv. 14  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Plasma Grunt will give you the Dragon Skull that was stolen. Gorm, who is
one of the Team Plasma sages, will appear. He is followed by Lenora and Burgh.
Gorm and the grunt will vanish, leaving the three of you to talk briefly. You
give Lenora the skull and she gives you a Moon Stone. The Moon Stone can
evolve certain Pokemon like Munna. Walk east after Lenora leaves to find a
Miracle Seed. Hop down the ledge and you will end up back at the road that
leads to the north and east exits. You can walk down south to battle some more
trainers. A School Girl who is staring at the trees will battle if you talk to
her.

That leads you back to the beginning of the forest. You can walk outside of
the forest where you entered and talk to the nurse to heal up before
continuing. Now you can walk all the way north on the road through the forest
to Skyarrow Bridge.

   Super Potion - West of the first Pokemon Ranger.
   TinyMushroom - South of the Super Potion, in two rows of grass. Walk all
                  the way south along the west side of the fence until you hit
                  a tree. Press up quickly to face north and press A. (Hidden)
   Antidote     - In the tree stump by the second Pokemon Ranger.
   Chesto Berry - Two are received from different Pokemon Rangers after they
                  have been defeated.

                        set of stairs, then north up another set of stairs.

2.17 Skyarrow Bridge                                                   [wskya]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
At the gate there is a Hiker who will give you a Quick Claw. The Quick Claw
is a very good hold item. It lets the holding Pokemon attack first,
regardless of their speed stat. Skyarrow Bridge doesn't have any events. All
you have to do is hold up and take in the sights. Eventually you will find
Castelia City.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Skyarrow Bridge:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Quick Claw - Received from the Hiker at the Pinwheel Forest gate.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.18 Castelia City                                                     [wcast]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The first thing to notice about Castelia City are all of the big buildings.
This city is huge. After you first enter from the Skyarrow Bridge gate you
can walk down to a pier. There is a scientist that will give you an elemental
stone. You can use it to evolve the elemental monkey you received back in the
Dreamyard if you want. Return to the main road and then walk left until you
find the Pokemon Center.

Inside the Pokemon Center there will be someone in line at the healing
station. Talk to her and she will ask you to walk upstairs to the globe and
select where you live in the world. This is used when you battle other people
online.

Before we walk up any of the roads to go into inner Castelia City, walk left
from the Pokemon Center to find different buildings to explore. The first
building you can enter has brown and green doors. This is the Battle Company.
When you walk inside, a man with gray hair will talk to you before talking
the elevator up. Enter the elevator and go to floor 47. Up here are a bunch
of people waiting to battle. The closest girl is a Clerk.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Clerk Ingrid
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Herdier  Lv. 19  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you talk to the man to the right of the Clerk, he will give you three Quick
Balls and three Timer Balls. Quick Balls are four times stronger than a
regular Poke Ball if they are used on the first turn of battle. After the
first turn, they are just as strong as a Poke Ball. In contrast, Timer Balls
get stronger after each turn of a battle. There is a Clerk to the left.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Clerk Clemens
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Timburr  Lv. 19  Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

South of him is another Clerk.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Clerk Alberta
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Petilil   Lv. 18  Grass
   Cottonee  Lv. 18  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below her is a Revive. When one of your Pokemon faints, use a Revive to heal
its HP half way instead of walking all the way back to a Pokemon Center. To
the right is a scientist.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scientist Randall
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Roggenrola  Lv. 19  Rock
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the right is another Clerk.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Clerk Warren
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Basculin  Lv. 17  Water
   Basculin  Lv. 17  Water
   Basculin  Lv. 17  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the right is a scientist that will give you a Scope Lens, which gives the
holder a better chance of getting critical hits. Head back to the elevator
and go to floor 55. Walk down to find a Hyper Potion. Hyper Potions heal 200
HP, which is probably too powerful for any of your Pokemon right now so you
may want to save it. To the left is a Clerk.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Clerk Ivan
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Woobat  Lv. 20  Psychic/Flying
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below him is a Scientist.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scientist Samantha
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Munna  Lv. 20  Psychic
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the right is a male Scientist.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scientist Steve
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sewaddle  Lv. 20  Bug/Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk up to fight a Clerk with all three elemental monkeys.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Clerk Wade
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansear  Lv. 19  Fire
   Panpour  Lv. 19  Water
   Pansage  Lv. 19  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continue walking up and talk to the guy at the desk. Be careful because his
Trubbish has Toxic Spikes, a move that lays down spikes that will poison any
Pokemon that you send out.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Janitor Geoff
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Trubbish  Lv. 20  Poison
   Minccino  Lv. 20  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He will give you Exp. Share. If a Pokemon holds Exp. Share it will get
experience from any battle, even if it didn't get sent out. It's a great item
when you catch a new Pokemon that is a low level. That's all there is to do
at the Battle Company, so head down the elevator and back outside.

The building to the left of the Battle Company is the Passerby Analytics HQ.
Talk to the scientist and he will appoint you as a statistician. This means
you can answer questionnaires and get information from other people while your
C-Gear is in PasserBy mode. If you talk to the blonde-haired woman in the
northwest corner of the building she will ask you to answer some
questionnaires. She will add the questionnaire to your Survey Radar after each
one you complete. If you take all 9 questionnaires she will give you a Soda
Pop. The Passerby Analytics HQ is the last building on this road that you can
enter, so now it's time to start traveling up the different streets. Walk up
the west-most street towards the Pokemon Gym.

The entrance on the right side of this street is the Castelia Gym. Cheren
pops out as you try to enter. Once he leaves, Burgh comes out and says Team
Plasma is in Castelia before leaving for the piers. You can find them at the
middle of the five piers back by the Battle Company. Before going there you
should finish exploring Castelia for more items and battles.

The building on the left side of this street is empty for now, so you can
skip it and keep walking up. Now you are in the Central Plaza of the city.
There is a Dancer who wants to battle by the fountain.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Dancer Mickey
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansage  Lv. 21  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once he is defeated, he will challenge you to find two other Dancers and
defeat them to win a prize. North of the fountain is a set of vending
machines where you can buy drinks that heal HP. Walk down the middle-left
street of the four streets, Narrow Street. This is a very narrow alley
with two old men who don't want to be disturbed. Further down you can find
the second Dancer by the sewer hole.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Dancer Edmond
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Panpour  Lv. 21  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk down further to find a cafe. If you talk to the manager inside, she will
give you a free Lemonade which restores 80 HP. Back in the alley, if you walk
down even more there will be a sound coming from one of the dumpsters. This
may seem like a battle, but the guy in the suit actually gives you TM 70,
Flash. In-battle, Flash will lower your opponent's accuracy. In-field, Flash
will light up dark caves. Make your way back to the main road or the Central
Plaza and enter the middle-right street, Mode Street.

This area is hustling and bustling. There are plenty of business people
running about. Don't worry about running into any of them because they will
dodge you. On the right side of this street is an art gallery with a
Harlequin inside. He will ask you to show him a certain type of Pokemon each
day. If you show him the correct type of Pokemon, you will get a berry as a
reward. The type of Pokemon and berry is different every day. That's all
there is to do on this street, so make your way to the right-most street,
Castelia Street.

There are a lot of people walking on this street too. The building on the
right of this road has a special event. If you bring an event Celebi
transferred from Generation 4 using the Relocator to the lady on the first
floor, the person on the left will show its true form. It is actually a Zorua
that will join your party. Even if you don't have a Celebi, she will still
show you Zorua to fill in your Pokedex, which will help you out later.
Upstairs in this building is where the Game Freak crew reside. Game Freak,
the creators of Pokemon, always put a Game Freak headquarters in each game.
Usually there is a cool unlockable at a certain point in each game so you may
end up making your way back here.

Head back outside and enter the building on the left side of the street.
There is a woman who will give one of your Pokemon a massage once a day which
will increase their happiness. Some Pokemon only evolve through happiness, so
this is a good place to keep in mind. Upstairs is a hiker that gives TM 44,
Rest. Rest puts a Pokemon to sleep and replenishes all of his or her health.

Make your way to the fountain in the Central Plaza and keep walking north to
enter the street that leads to Route 4. On this street there are three
entrances. Go into the building on the left. Here you can find the Name Rater.
If you want to give any of your Pokemon a new nickname he is the guy that can
do it. Upstairs is a scientist that wants you to tell him a phrase in order
to unlock the machine he created. The phrase is:

1. EVERYONE HAPPY
2. SIMPLE   CONNECTION

This unlocks the Relocator, which can be accessed from the main menu. It
allows you to transfer event Pokemon from Generation 4 games such as Celebi
and the three shiny beasts which can unlock special events in Black and
White. These event Pokemon were given away at GameStop and over WiFi in 2010.

Back outside, walk across the street and enter the southern entrance of the
building on the right. There is a guy in a suit and sunglasses blocking the
elevator. Answer yes to his question and he will let you to use the elevator.
Go to the 47th floor. There is a party going on in this room and there are
people from all over the world. If you talk to the little girl with pigtails,
she will give you TM 45, Attract. This move can be used against Pokemon of
the opposite gender to cause infatuation. An infatuated Pokemon will not
attack half of the time because it is in love. Go back outside and use the
second entrance of this building.

There is a scientist by the TV that will give you the Eviolite if
you have seen over 25 Pokemon. The Eviolite will increase Defense
and Special Defense by 50% if the Pokemon holding can still evolve. There
isn't anything of note usdtairs in this building, so you have explored all of
Castelia City other than the piers. Head back to the southern-most part of
Castelia City and go to the pier in between the Passerby Analytics HQ and the
Battle Company, Unity Pier. There you will find the final Dancer.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Dancer Raymond
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansear  Lv. 21  Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once defeated, he will go back to the city fountain. If you have beaten all
three Dancers, go to the fountain and talk to the middle Dancer to get an
Amulet Coin. It will double the money you receive after a battle if the
Pokemon holding it participated. There is currently nothing to do at the left
pier and the middle-right pier so head off to the middle pier, Prime Pier, to
meet up with Burgh. Make sure you have already tried to enter the Castelia
Gym, otherwise Burgh won't be at the pier. Once you enter the middle pier,
Burgh, Bianca, and Iris will tell you Team Plasma stole Bianca's Munna. A
Team Plasma member will show up before running away. Burgh will chase down
the Team Plasma member and you need to follow him. Head west toward the gym.
Across the street from the gym is Burgh staring down some Plasma grunts. As
you walk up, the grunts will talk and you should answer yes to their question
to start a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sandile  Lv. 17  Ground/Dark
   Sandile  Lv. 17  Ground/Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the battle is over, all of the grunts will run inside. Bianca and Iris
show up and talk briefly before Burgh high-tails it into the building. Bianca
and Iris follow Burgh, which leaves you no choice but to follow as well.
After a lot of talking, a Munna runs away from Team Plasma into Bianca's arms.
Team Plasma vanishes and Iris gives you a Yache Berry, which makes super
effective Ice moves do half damage to the holder. Once everyone leaves, you
can pick up the stray Smoke Ball that Team Plasma left behind. A Smoke Ball
allows you to run away from a wild Pokemon without fail as long as your
active Pokemon is holding it. Now that Team Plasma is out of Castelia City,
Burgh is free to battle you in the gym across the street.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Castelia City:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Leaf Stone      - Received from the man on the right-most pier if the
                     first option is chosen.

2.18.1 Liberty Garden                                                  [wlibe]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Liberty Garden, also referred to as Liberty Island, can be accessed by riding
the boat at Liberty Pier in Castelia City. It is the west-most pier. You need
to get the Liberty Pass through Mystery Gift over WiFi in order to ride the
boat. Make sure to stock up on Ultra Balls before you go to Liberty Garden.
You will have the chance to catch a Victini at the end of this side quest.
Bring Pokemon that are around level 15 or else you will knock Victini out too
easily. Pokemon that can Paralyze or cause Sleep are good to have.

You will see a group of people standing by the dock once you arrive. They are
being corralled by Team Plasma, who have taken over the island. Walk east
past the officer to battle the first Plasma Grunt.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Sandile  Lv. 17  Ground/Dark
   Patrat   Lv. 17  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a vending machine to the west if you need any healing items. If not,
continue north toward the lighthouse to battle another Plasma Grunt.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sandile  Lv. 18  /Ground/Dark

Continue north to battle a Plasma Grunt.

   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Patrat   Lv. 17  Normal
   Scraggy  Lv. 17  Dark/Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk through the doorway and you will find Victini and a Plasma Grunt. He
explains their plans for Victini, but you need to put a stop to it.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Watchog  Lv. 20  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike most legendary Pokemon, there is not only one chance to catch Victini.
If you accidentally run away or knock it out, just exit the room and enter
again to make Victini reappear. You still may want to save before interacting
with it. Victini is harder to catch than a regular Pokemon because of its
legendary status.

Walk outside after you catch Victini. Some police officers will be leading
the Plasma Grunts away and Juniper will congratulate you.

2.19 Castelia City Gym                                                 [wgcas]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Castelia's gym is filled with trainers that love Bug-type Pokemon, which are
weak against Flying-type Pokemon. Some Bug Pokemon like Sewaddle and Leavanny
are also Grass type, so they will be weak against Fire-type moves too. A
combination of Flying and Fire Pokemon will give you a good head start. Bug
type moves are super effective against Grass Pokemon so you will be at a
disadvantage if you started with Snivy.

Make sure to talk to the white-haired gym guide to get a free Fresh Water.
This gym is like a honeycomb. Keep pressing forward to walk through the wall
of honey. Past the honey is a switch. Step on it and a gate to the left will
drop down. To the right is a Harlequin who wants to battle.

Continue walking right to the next switch. It will lower the gate next to the
Harlequin you just beat. Walk through the new honey wall and step on the
switch for another Harlequin battle. He has a Dwebble, a Pokemon you haven't
seen before. It is part Rock type so it is weak against Water attacks.

   Dwebble   Lv. 20  Bug/Rock

Step on the switch to the right of the Harlequin, followed by the switch to
the left. This will lower the gate behind the Harlequin. Walk up through the
honey wall behind the Harlequin and step on the switch to turn on one green
light on the post to the left. Walk down through the honey wall and walk left
until you find another switch, which will open a gate to the left. Walk down
through the honey wall and step on the switch to the left for a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Harlequin Rick
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sewaddle  Lv. 21  Bug/Grass

and walk through the honey wall. There will be one last Harlequin waiting to
battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step on the switch to open the final gate in the gym. Burgh is at the top of
the purple stairs waiting to battle with the Beetle Badge on the line. Burgh
has three strong Bug Pokemon. If you have a Fire Pokemon like Tepig/Pignite
or Pansear/Simisear at level 25 or higher then this battle should be
extremely easy, especially with a Charcoal equipped. You may want to visit
Route 4, north of Castelia City, if you don't have any Fire Pokemon. There
you can catch a Darumaka. Dwebble is the only problem for your Fire Pokemon,
so use a Water Pokemon on it if possible. As always, it is a good time to
heal up and save before a battle with a gym leader.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gym Leader Burgh

   Dwebble     Lv. 21  Bug/Rock
   Leavanny    Lv. 23  Bug/Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once Burgh is defeated, he will give you the Beetle Badge and TM 76, Struggle
Bug. It is a move that deals damage and lowers the opponent's Special Attack
stat by one stage. As you walk outside, Bianca calls you on the Xtransceiver
and says you two will battle on Route 4. Heal your Pokemon and stock up on
items before heading north to Route 4.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Castelia City Gym:

You will have an Xtransceiver call with Cheren and Professor Juniper after
the battle. There is an X Accuracy to the west, which increases a Pokemon's
accuracy for one battle. North of the X Accuracy is a house where you can
heal your Pokemon. Keep heading west from the house, through the rocks, until
you see some stairs. Walk down the stairs and there are two Fishermen to
battle.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There are trainers with a variety of different Pokemon in the Desert Resort,
so be ready. North of the entrance is a Doctor ready to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Doctor Jerry
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Solosis  Lv. 23  Psychic
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Doctor will heal your Pokemon after the battle. If you need your Pokemon
healed again just talk to him. To the west, on top of the hill, is a male
Backpacker. He has a Tranquill with Roost, which restores HP but makes the
Pokemon Normal type for one turn. That means you can hit it with Ground-type
attacks for that turn.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Backpacker Kelsey
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Tranquill  Lv. 23  Normal/Flying

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

West of her are BlackGlasses. They boost Dark-type attacks by 20 percent when
held. Continue north and talk to the man in black. He will give you a Soft
Sand, which will boost Ground-type attacks by 20 percent when held. Walk
northwest and you will find a bunch of things that look like statues. They
are actually Darmanitan, the evolution of Darumaka. South of the Darmanitan
is a Fresh Water and a female Psychic to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Psychic Cybil
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gothita  Lv. 24  Psychic

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Backpacker Elaine
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Maractus  Lv. 23  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

West of her is a Super Potion. If you continue walking west, you will find a
Heart Scale in the northwest corner of the Desert Resort. Heart Scales can be
given to a Move Relearner to teach a Pokemon a move that has been deleted.
From the Heart Scale, walk south past the tower to find a Psychic running
around. He has a Yamask, which is an interesting Pokemon. Yamask's ability is
Mummy. When you attack Yamask with a physical move, your Pokemon's ability
will be replaced with Mummy. It can mess you up if your Pokemon's ability is
a big part of your strategy. Yamask is a Ghost-type Pokemon so Normal-type
attacks will not hit it.

passageway west between the rocks to battle another Pokemon Ranger.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Jaden
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Darumaka  Lv. 23  Fire
   Blitzle   Lv. 23  Electric
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He will also give you a Rawst Berry. Walk south and you will find TM 39, Rock
Tomb. This move deals damage, lowers your opponent's speed, and may cause
flinching. It's an okay move to use if you find yourself needing a Rock-type
move in the future. Make your way back to the female Pokemon Ranger and go
south until you find a Fire Stone. Walk east to fight a Psychic pacing back
and forth.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

To prevent yourself from falling down the quicksand you need to walk, not
run, and avoid the center. As long as you walk on the outside edge you won't
fall through. If you fall down any of the quicksand you can find a Revive in
the basement. There is a Backpacker past the third quicksand that will give
you a fossil. If you choose the first option, she will give you a Cover
Fossil which resurrects Tirtouga, a Water and Rock type. The second choice
nabs you the Plume Fossil which resurrects Archen, a Flying and Rock type.
You can take either of the fossils back to the Nacrene City Museum to
resurrect it into the respective Pokemon at level 25. The Worker won't let
you go any further so that is all you can do for now. Head back to Route 4
and take the northern exit to Nimbasa City.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Professor Juniper will give you an Ultra Ball in the Route 4 passageway, 
followed by an explanation of why everyone was chosen for the adventure. As 
you enter Nimbasa City you will see some Plasma members trying to steal 
Pokemon from the Day-Care Man. Naturally, this leads to a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Watchog   Lv. 18  Normal
   Trubbish  Lv. 18  Poison
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The grunts leave and say they are going to hide in the amusement park. The 
Day-Care Man gives you the Bike, one of the most useful items in the game. 
Select the Bike in your bag and register it so you can hop on by pressing Y. 
This makes it quick and easy to get on your Bike. After the Day-Care Man 
leaves, Bianca shows up and says she is going to see a musical. Head over to 
the northeast corner of the city to see Bianca standing in front of the Music 
Theater. She will take you inside and you will meet the owner who will give 
you a Prop Case. The Prop Case holds decorations for your Pokemon to wear. 
You are given the chance to decorate a Pokemon of your choice. Once you're 
finished, talk to the girl east of the front desk to get TM 49 Echoed Voice. 
This move gets more powerful each turn you consecutively use it.

You can participate in the Pokemon Musical if you want, but it isn't that 
useful or exciting. It is like the spiritual successor to the Pokemon Contest 
in Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald. You can dress up your Pokemon and press the 
"Appeal" button at a strategic moment to get the crowd on your side. There 
aren't any items that you can get other than more accessories for your 
Pokemon to wear. Because of this, I'm not going to delve too deep into the 
Pokemon Musical.

Walk outside when you're ready. You will enter a conversation with Bianca and 
her Dad. He insists on bringing her back home to Nuvema Town, but Bianca 
wants to continue with her adventure. Elesa approaches and persuades Bianca's 
Dad to reconsider. It plays into the classic adage, "If you hold a butterfly 
too tight, you might crush it." It's nice to see the Pokemon games give an 
attempt at emotional ties to the characters.

West of the Music Theater is the passageway to Route 16 where you can get a 
Macho Brace from an Infielder. East of the Music Theater is the Big Stadium. 
Depending on the day, you can battle a Linebacker, an Infielder, or a Striker 
once per day.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Linebacker Dan
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Darumaka  Lv. 24  Fire
   Timburr   Lv. 24  Fighting

   Pansage  Lv. 23  Grass
   Pansear  Lv. 23  Fire
   Panpour  Lv. 23  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

East of the Big Stadium is the Small Court where you can battle either a 
Hoopster or a Smasher once per day.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hoopster Bobby
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Whirlipede  Lv. 25  Bug/Poison

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Blitzle  Lv. 25  Electric
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head to the southwest corner of Nimbasa City if you need to heal your 
Pokemon. The building west of the Pokemon Center can't be used until after 
you beat the game, so don't bother entering it for now. Enter the building 
northwest of the Pokemon Center and talk to the blue-haired guy on the first 
floor to get HM 04 Strength. Strength allows you to moves large boulders, but 
not until you get the Bolt Badge from Elesa. Upstairs in this building is an 
old lady that will give you a Soothe Bell if the Pokemon in the first slot of 
your party has high happiness. A Pokemon that holds the Soothe Bell will gain 
happiness faster than normal.

The building directly north of the Pokemon Center has a blue-haired guy 
upstairs that will give you a Sun Stone. You can use that to evolve a 
Cottonee or Petilil if you caught on ein Pinwheel Forest.

The building east of the Pokemon Center is the Battle Subway. As you try to 
enter, a blue-haired girl will give you the Vs Recorder. The Vs Recorder 
keeps records of the Battle Subway and can save recordings of Pokemon 
battles. There are a lot of trains down here. When you ride one, you will 
battle trainers in succession in order to earn Battle Points (BP). You can 
use BP to buy things like TMs and other rare items. Unfortunately, not all of 
the trains can be ridden your first time in Nimbasa so make sure to come back 
here later on.

Walk east from the Battle Subway to enter the Amusement Park. Keep walking 
east to find N. He leads you to the ferris wheel. You both ride and he 
divulges some details about Team Plasma. Some grunts show up. He wants to 
battle you to let his grunts flee.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   N
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sandile    Lv. 22  Ground/Dark
   Darumaka   Lv. 22  Fire
   Scraggy    Lv. 22  Dark/Fighting
   Sigilyph   Lv. 22  Psychic/Flying
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can walk south after the battle to find an X Attack by the bench. Now you 
can enter the Nimbasa City Gym west of the ferris wheel to battle Elesa for 
the Bolt Badge.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
As always, the white-haired guy at the beginning of the gym will give you a 
Fresh Water.

The trainers in this gym specialize in Electric Pokemon. Ground Pokemon like 
Sandile are not affected by Electric attacks at all so they are a good choice 
to use. This gym is a set of roller coasters. Take the first coaster with the 
blue track and take the first exit. You'll find a Lady before the switch.

Hop into the coaster and ride it to the first exit. Hit the purple switch to 
turn it orange. As you try to get into the coaster a Lady will pop out for a 
battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lady Colette
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Emolga  Lv. 25  Electric/Flying
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter the coaster and ride it to the first exit. Walk north to battle Elesa. 
She has two Pokemon that are part Flying-type and her Blitzle knows Flame 
Charge so Grass Pokemon will have a rough time. The easiest Pokemon to use 
against Elesa at this stage of the game is Sandile because he has complete 
resistance to Electric attacks.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gym Leader Elesa

She will give you the Bolt Badge after defeat. It lets you use Strength 
outside of battle to moves big boulders. She also gives you TM 72 Volt 
Switch. It is a special attack that lets the user switch with another Pokemon 
in your party after the attack hits.

Head to Route 16 at the northeast corner of the city.

At the end of this road is the entrance to Marvelous Bridge. Unfortunately, 
there are Workers blocking the way for now because the bridge is being 
checked. Walk back to the big boulder and use Strength to move it out of the 
way. There is a Backpacker to the north.

fence and the trees. Go back to the first opening in the fence and walk north 
to battle a Backpacker.

Walk north to the tree stump to find a Big Mushroom. Keep walking north and 
you'll run into a backpacker that says there is a woman who prefers to be 
alone in the camper. If you have brought an event Shiny Raikou, Entei, or 
Suicune over from a Generation IV game with the Relocator, she will show her 
true form as you try to enter the camper. She is actually a Zoroark that you 
can catch.

Inside of this camper is a Maid who will buy food items like Big Mushrooms 
from you for a higher price than what a Poke Mart will give. If you walk 
between the south fence and the trees you will eventually find a Hyper 
Potion. Northeast of the camper is a Backpacker standing in front of a Great 
Ball.

There is a Revive next to him. You can also find a Zinc through the thick

You may find a shadow as you are walking across the bridge. If you walk into 
it you will either find a Ducklett to battle or a wing to pick up. The Pretty 
Wing has no use other than to be sold. All other wings will increase a 
specific EV stat of the Pokemon by one point. If you don't know what EVs are, 
check out the EV guide on my website. There is no need to know what EVs are 
unless you plan on battling competitively online.

Just keep walking west and you will enter Driftveil City.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Go west past the statue and over the bridge until you run into Cheren and 
Clay, the gym leader of Driftveil. He says that the Team Plasma members he 
had caught escaped as he was lowering the bridge for you. You need to catch 
them before you can battle for his badge.

After Cheren is done talking, you can enter the western house and talk to the 
blue-haired guy to teach a starter Pokemon a special move. He will teach 
Grass Pledge, Fire Pledge, or Water Pledge. If you use two of the moves 
together in a double or triple battle, there is a special effect that 
happens. Other than that the move isn't very useful. It only has 50 Power and 
your starter most likely has a more powerful move already.

Go to the northeast house and talk to the old man. If you have seen more than 
50 Pokemon, he will give you a Shell Bell. A Shell Bell will heal 1/8 of the 
damage a Pokemon deals at the end of a turn. It is a very good item to use 
throughout the game. There is also a Youngster in the house that will trade 
his Basculin for your Minccino. It may not seem like a worthwhile trade, but 
he actually gives you the form of Basculin that you can't catch in your game. 
In Black you will receive the Red-Striped form, and in White you will receive 
the Blue-Striped form.

West of the four houses is the Driftveil City Market. If you talk to the guy 
in sunglasses with a Pokemon at level 30 or higher, he will give you the 
Expert Belt. It increases the power of super-effective moves by 20%. You can 
buy some items here, but nothing too spectacular. The girl in the 
northwestern corner is selling Moomoo Milk. It heals 100 HP so it isn't a bad 
deal. If you enter the Market from the west side's hidden entrance, you can 
find a Big Pearl. It can be sold for $3750 at a Poke Mart.

West of the Market is a Motorcyclist that will teach you about Rotation 
Battles. His name is Charles...he's a heartbreaker. After his brief 
explanation, you can have a Rotation Battle with him. The only difference 
with a Rotation Battle is the fact that three of your Pokemon are out at once 
but only one is active. Also, you can choose to rotate a different Pokemon in 
front while choosing an attack. You can attack the same turn with the Pokemon 
you switch into.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Motorcyclist Charles  (He's a heartbreaker)

   Krokorok   Lv. 27  Ground/Dark
   Zebstrika  Lv. 27  Electric
   Basculin   Lv. 27  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Northeast of the Market is the Pokemon Center. If you talk to the girl 
upstairs, she will give you three Repeat Balls. A Repeat Ball is three times 
more likely to catch a Pokemon if you have already caught one of the same 
species before.

You can get a Heart Scale once per day in the house west of the Pokemon 
Center if you show the lady a Pokemon with the move she requests. She will 
ask for a different move every day. Northwest of this house is an opening in 
the trees where you can find an Ultra Ball.

That's all there is to do in Driftveil for now, so head south to the Cold 
Storage.

The Worker in between the two buildings will give you a Rocky Helmet. A 
Pokemon that uses a physical attack against your Pokemon with Rocky Helmet 
will be dealt damage equal to 1/8 of their total HP. There is a Youngster to 
the east.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Youngster Kenneth
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Whirlipede  Lv. 24  Bug/Poison
   Karrablast  Lv. 24  Bug

   Joltik   Lv. 24  Bug/Electric
   Dwebble  Lv. 24  Bug/Rock
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head back to the beginning of the area and head south. The trash can by the 
vending machine holds a hidden PP Up. It will increase the PP of one move. 
Walk east through the grass to find an Ether. Continue through the grass to 
find a Worker to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Worker Eddie
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansage  Lv. 24  Grass
   Timburr  Lv. 24  Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

East of Worker Eddie is a Protein in the thick grass. A Protein increases the 
Attack stat of a Pokemon. Head back west toward the vending machine and then 
head south. As you pass the Worker, Cheren will appear. If you walk through 
the grass west of the Cold Storage building, you can find a Heart Scale. 
There are going to be Ice-type Pokemon in the Cold Storage so you may want to 
have a Fire or Fighting Pokemon handy. Enter the building and Cheren will 
follow.

Go up the stairs near the worker to the west to find a Net Ball. Go back down 
the stairs and you will find a floor covered in ice. Anybody who has played a 
Pokemon game before knows how this works. The first step you take on the ice 
slides you in the direction you were walking until you hit an object. If you 
walk up on the very left square of ice, you will slide into a wall of ice. 
Then press right and you will slide to the opposite side. Press down and you 
will slide into TM 55 Scald. It is a Water move that can burn which is a 
pretty interesting combination. Go back to the start of the ice and walk up 
on any other square and then walk right to battle a Worker.

   Worker Victor
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pansear  Lv. 24  Fire

   Timburr  Lv. 24  Fighting

Here is how you progress through the third ice patch to the east: walk right, 
up, left, then down. This will lead you to a set of brown crates with a 
Worker waiting at the top of the stairs.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Worker Filipe
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gurdurr  Lv. 25  Fighting

There is an Ice Heal near this Worker. Head north and walk up onto the ice 
patch on one of the two left-most pieces. Keep heading north to fight a 
shivering Worker.

   Timburr    Lv. 23  Fighting
   Vanillite  Lv. 23  Ice
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a Hyper Potion to the northeast of Worker Ryan. Try to enter the 
open crate to the west and Cheren will appear. He will ask if anybody is 
inside. Say yes. Now is a good time to save if you haven't in a while. Walk 
inside the crate when you're ready.

Zinzolin, one of the seven Plasma Sages, is inside with eight Plasma Grunts 
huddled around him for warmth. After some talking, walk straight and fight 
the first grunt, followed by the three grunts to the right.

Clay will barge in after you've defeated the last Plasma Grunt. Clay's 
Workers will take the Plasma members away and he will tell you to come 
challenge him at the Driftveil City Gym. After Cheren leaves, pick up the 
NeverMeltIce in the northwest corner of the room. It boosts Ice moves by 20%. 
There is nothing left to do here now so go back to Driftveil and head to the 
gym in the northeast part of the city.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
As you approach the gym, Ghetsis will convince Clay to free Zinzolin and the 
grunts. Cheren decides to train his Pokemon before battling Clay so he runs 
off. Walk inside the gym and talk to the white-haired guy to get a free Fresh 
Water. This gym is a mine and Clay is at the bottom. All of the trainers here 
use Ground-type Pokemon. Grass and Water moves will be super effective 
against most Pokemon here. The exception is Palpitoad, who is Water and 
Ground type. Water moves are normally effective and Grass moves do four times 
the normal damage to Palpitoad. Fire Pokemon are at a big disadvantage in 
this gym.

There is a platform at the north end of the room with a button on each side, 
up and down. Go to the down button and press A to go down one floor. There is 
a platform to the east that can take you down one more floor, but first you 
must battle a Worker.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Worker Felix
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Palpitoad  Lv. 28  Water/Ground
   Drilbur    Lv. 28  Ground

Go down one floor and use the elevator to the north to battle another Worker.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Worker Sterling
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sandile  Lv. 28  Ground/Dark
   Drilbur  Lv. 28  Ground

This is a dead end, so take the elevator back down and walk north onto the 
railing. Follow it west and then south to find another elevator with a Worker 
guarding it.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Worker Don
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Krokorok  Lv. 29  Ground/Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take this elevator down and you will have two choices, north and east. The 
east elevator leads to a male Clerk to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Clerk Isaac
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sandile    Lv. 27  Ground/Dark
   Palpitoad  Lv. 27  Water/Ground
   Sandile    Lv. 27  Ground/Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take this same elevator back down and take the north elevator up this time. 
It will take you back to the top floor. Walk north onto the railing and then 
east to battle a female Clerk.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Clerk Katie
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Drilbur  Lv. 29  Ground
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk onto the elevator south of Clerk Katie and take the elevator down. This 
will take you all the way down to Clay. Save before the battle if you want. 
All of Clay's Pokemon can be knocked out easily with Grass moves. All of his 
Pokemon have hard-hitting attacks, so you may want to use an X Defend for 
this battle if you have one on hand.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gym Leader Clay

   Krokorok   Lv. 29  Ground/Dark

Clay will give you the Quake Badge for defeating him. He tells you to wait 
for him in front of the cave on Route 6. Head to the Pokemon Center to heal 
your Pokemon and then head west to Route 6.

As you enter the route, Bianca will stop you for a battle.

   (If Oshawott was chosen)  Pansage   Lv. 26  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bianca gives you HM 02 Fly after the battle. Fly is probably the most useful 
HM in the game. It allows you to instantly transport to any city or town you 
have already visited. In battle, the Pokemon flys up into the sky where it is 
unable to be hit by most attacks during the first turn, then it deals damage 
the second turn. Go west to cross the bridge and continue north through the 
grass to find a Scientist. All of the Scientists on this route use X items to 
increase one of their Deerling's stats during the first turn of battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scientist Ron
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Deerling  Lv. 27  Normal/Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an Elixir in the grass near the Scientist. The big building here is 
the Season Research Lab. There is a Scientist inside that will give you a 
Leaf Stone if you show him all four forms of Deerling. Deerling has a 
different form for each season. There is a Hyper Potion to the west of the 
lab. Continue west along the path to battle a female Scientist.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scientist Maria
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Deerling  Lv. 27  Normal/Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep going west across the fourth bridge to find what looks like an item. If 
you inspect it, you will find out that it is actually a Foongus. This sneaky 
Pokemon looks just like a Poke Ball from above. Knock it out or catch it and 
then battle the Parasol Lady. She has a Frillish. It is Water and Ghost-type 
so it won't be affected by Normal attacks and it has quite a few resistances.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Parasol Lady Tihana

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first item west of her is a Leaf Stone. You can use it to evolve a 
Pansage, Cottonee, or Petilil if you want. The item southwest of the Leaf 
Stone is another Foongus. There is a Pokemon Ranger walking nearby to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Richard
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Minccino  Lv. 27  Normal
   Emolga    Lv. 27  Electric/Flying
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He will give you a Cheri Berry after you defeat him. Walk north to cross the 
fifth bridge and enter the house to the east. Talk to the little girl inside 
and she will give you a Shiny Stone. You can use it to evolve a Minccino. You 
can also heal your Pokemon by talking to the lady at the table. Exit the 
house and walk north to Chargestone Cave. Walk up to the yellow spider web 
and inspect it. Clay will appear and get his Krokorok to remove the web. He 
also gives you TM 78 Bulldoze. It does damage and lowers your opponent's 
speed. Clay will leave so now you can enter Chargestone Cave.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You may notice swirling dust in this cave. When you walk into it you will 
either battle a Drilbur or find a gem. There are a total of 17 gems, one for 
each Pokemon type. These gems are a one-time use item that increase the 
attacks of the corresponding type by 50% when held.

~1F~

As you enter the cave, some people will teleport in front and behind you and 
rush you over to N. It turns out they are the Shadow Triad, faithful servants 
of N and Ghetsis. N will leave once he's done talking. Walk north until you 
are stopped by Bianca. Professor Juniper will show up too and give you the 
Lucky Egg. It makes a Pokemon gain more experience when it is held. Walk up 
to the floating rock that Bianca is standing next to and push it to the left. 
It is magnetized to the bigger rock so it will slam into it. Continue north 
and you will find an item, but the path to it is blocked by another floating 
rock. Push the rock to the right and pick up the Parlyz Heal. Take the east 
stairs to battle a Scientist.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two floating rocks near the Ace Trainer that need to be moved. The 
northern one needs to be pushed left and the southern one needs to be pushed 
down. The will let you walk south along the ledge and then down a set of 
stairs. Walk east and right as you are about to walk past the floating rock 
Juniper will stop you and talk about Klink being around for about 100 years. 
There are two paths here, north and south. Take the north path and battle the 
Hiker by talking to him.

Take the south path near Juniper and Bianca and you will find a bridge. Right 
as you walk on it, the Shadow Triad will appear again and rush you across the 
bridge. They say Team Plasma is waiting for you downstairs. There is a Hyper 
Potion to the north after the Shadow Triad disappear. Push the floating rock 
down and battle the Scientist near the stairs.

If you walk south of the stairs and go west, you will find two floating 
rocks. Push the southern rock left and walk around the big rock to find an 
Iron, which increases a Pokemon's Defense stat. Go down the stairs.

~B1F~

Follow the path until you see a set of brothers standing by a wall. They are 
the Nugget Brothers and they will each give you a Nugget for talking to them. 
A Nugget can be sold for $5000 at a Poke Mart. Keep going west and walk up 
the stairs.

Don't walk off the ledge because it will lead you to the very beginning of 
the cave. If you walk around the stairs to the east and head south there is a 
hidden HP Up underneath the tiny floating rock. Head back to the Nugget 
Brothers. Walk north and take the west path to battle a Doctor.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The first building you see is the Pokemon Center. This is the first place 
where you can buy Ultra Balls. There is a man inside the Pokemon Center that 
will tell you the type of a Pokemon's Hidden Power. Hidden Power is a move 
that has a type based on the Pokemon's individual values. Any specific of 
Pokemon can have any Hidden Power type. For example, a Samurott (Water-type) 
could potentially have an Electric Hidden Power type. This is a good thing to 
keep in mind if you ever plan on getting into competitive battling, otherwise 
it shouldn't be too important to you. The house east of the Pokemon Center 
has the Move Deleter and Move Relearner. You need a Heart Scale to have a 
Pokemon relearn a move but deleting a move is free.

As you try to walk north past the Pokemon Center, a man will appear and talk 
to you. He is Professor Juniper's dad, Cedric Juniper. He will upgrade your 
Pokedex for you so it detects different Pokemon forms and has a better search 
function. He also introduces you to Skyla, the leader of the Mistralton Gym. 
She says she is going to the Celestial Tower on Route 7.

Before heading to Route 7, walk to the east and enter the control tower near 
the officer. Talk to the first woman you see inside to get the Sharp Beak. It 
increases the power of Flying-type moves by 20%. Walk back outside and head 
south down the runway to find TM 58 Sky Drop near a plane. Sky Drop takes the 
user and the target up into the sky the first turn and slams the target down 
the second turn to deal damage.

That's all there is to do in Mistralton for now, so go to Route 7 in the 
northeast corner of town. 

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Mistralton City:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sharp Beak       - Received from a woman in the control tower.
   TM 58 (Sky Drop) - Near a plane on the runway south of the control tower.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There are three paths at the beginning of Route 7. You can go through the 
grass, around the grass, or walk on the wood plank over the grass. You can 
fall off these wood planks so be careful if you don't want to fall into the 
grass. There are two Youngsters to battle and an Ultra Ball in the grass.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you go up the stairs and around the grass, talk to the Battle Girl and she 
will give you TM 57 Charge Beam. It has a chance of raising the user's 
Special Attack when used. Northwest of the Battle Girl is a Backpacker.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Backpacker Terrance
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Simisear  Lv. 31  Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

No matter which way you take, you will eventually come across a house to the 
north. Inside the house is a Hiker that will trade his Emolga for a Boldore. 
This is a pretty good trade because Emolga are hard to find. It is level 30 
and comes holding a Lum Berry. As you might remember from the Nimbasa City 
Gym, Emolga is only weak to Ice and Rock while having 6 different 
resistances. That being said, it is a very solid Pokemon to have. Go east 
from the house to battle an Ace Trainer in a Triple Battle.

a PP Up. Go back to the path and travel north to battle another Pokemon 
Ranger.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Pedro
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Solosis  Lv. 31  Psychic
   Axew     Lv. 31  Dragon
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He will also give you an Aspear Berry after battle. East of Pokemon Ranger 
Pedro is a Max Ether. Walk north and you will find the Celestial Tower. 
Before you enter it, there are still some trainers to battle and items to 
find. Walk south from the Celestial Tower until you see a wood plank to the 
east. Walk on it and enter the house. The purple-haired girl in front of the 
TV will heal your Pokemon for you. Walk east from the house to see a wood 
plank above some tall, dark grass. There is a Harlequin walking on it.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Harlequin Pat
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Emolga    Lv. 30  Electric/Flying
   Sigilyph  Lv. 30  Psychic/Flying

The guy at the front of the gym will give you a Fresh Water as usual. This 
gym has trainers that specialize in Flying-type Pokemon. Flying Pokemon are 
weak to Rock, Ice, and Electric attacks. In contrast, avoid using Grass, 
Fighting, and Bug Pokemon in this gym because they are weak to Flying 
attacks. The unique feature of this gym is cannons. They will shoot you in 
whatever way you walk into them. Walk up into the first cannon to be shot off 
into the air. Walk left into the cannon to the west. Walk down the stairs and 
east into the same cannon. You will land right by a Worker.

Use the cannon near him to go south, the next one to go east, the following 
one to go north, and the final one to go west to Skyla. You will land right 
in front of her. Heal your Pokemon and save before the battle. Her Swanna is 
very fast and its Air Slash attack does a lot of damage. Use Electric attacks 
on it if possible because they do quadruple damage against Swanna.

TM 62 Acrobatics, an attack that does double damage against Pokemon that 
aren't holding items. Skyla mentions seeing Team Plasma near Icirrus City. 
Walk around the cannon by Skyla and use it to go straight to the front of the 
gym. N will be outside waiting for you. He will talk to the first Pokemon in 
your party. It will tell him that you are a good trainer. He talks about 
finding the Dark and Light Stones to resurrect a legendary Dragon Pokemon. 
After some more talking, N will leave.

Grunt comes in and says they have found what they were looking for. After the 
Plasma Grunts leave, Cheren says he will stay at Twist Mountain to 
contemplate what he will do after he becomes powerful. Walk through the 
doorway to the east to enter Icirrus City.

Before heading off to Route 17, make sure you have an empty slot available in

can't accept it if you have a full party, so go to a Pokemon Center and drop
off one of your Pokemon.

Head to Route 1. You will see a set of stairs to the west leading to a body
of water. This eventually leads to Route 17. Surf west until you find land.
There is a Max Ether in the trees further west. Walk east to battle a Pokemon
Ranger.

Head northwest through the grass to a house. Inside is a blue-haired girl
that will heal your Pokemon. The Pokemon Ranger in this house will give you
an Egg with a Larvesta inside as long as you have an empty spot in your
party. Larvesta is Fire and Bug-type Pokemon. It's evolution, Volcorona, has
good Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed which means it is a great
Pokemon to use on your team. Unfortunately, it doesn't evolve until level 59,
so grinding up your level 1 Larvesta will take a long time. Back outside is a
Backpacker ready to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The item northwest of him is a Dragon Scale. A Seadra traded while holding a
Dragon Scale will evolve into Kingdra. Walk back to the beach and go north up
some stairs. Travel south through the thin path of grass to the west to find
HM 05 Waterfall at the end. In battle, it is a Water-type move that deals
damage. Outside of battle, it lets you travel up waterfalls. Head back north
until you find a big set of stairs with a Veteran at the top.

2.38.3 Mistralton Cave                                                 [wmisc]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Mistralton Cave is located on Route 6, southeast of the entrance to
Chargestone Cave. You need Surf in order to access this area. The big reason
to explore this cave is for the legendary Pokemon at the end, so bring plenty
of Ultra Balls.

Make sure you have a Pokemon that knows Flash before going into Mistralton
Cave. It is very dark and nearly impossible to navigate without it. If you
dont have TM 70 Flash, you can get it back in Castelia City in the alley with
the dumpsters and the Cafe. Also bring a Pokemon with Strength because you
can't get very far without it.

~1F~

From the entrance, use Flash and walk south to find a big boulder. Use
Strength to push it right twice and down twice into the hole. Continue south
up the stairs and east to find a Hiker.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hiker Hugh
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Drilbur  Lv. 33  Ground
   Gurdurr  Lv. 33  Fighting

Continue east to push the next boulder into the hole and pass over it. Walk
north up the stairs and battle the next Hiker.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hiker Clarke
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Boldore  Lv. 34  Rock
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a Max Repel east of Hiker Clarke. Northwest of him is a Hyper
Potion. The big boulder west of Hiker Clarke is a shortcut to the beginning
of the cave. Take the stairs southwest of him to go to the second floor.

~2F~

Walk down the eastern stairs and south to the big boulder. There is a Ultra
Ball hidden in the rock to the south. Push the boulder east into the hole.
There is a Hyper Potion hidden in the rock southeast of the hole. Walk up the
stairs to the north and east to the next set of stairs. Taking the south path
will eventually lead you to a Hard Stone, which increases the power of Rock
type attacks by 20%. Taking the north path leads to TM 80 Rock Slide. It
deals damage and can cause your opponent to flinch. Head back to the big
boulder and push it west into the hole. The next boulder west is just a
shortcut back to the beginning of the floor, so head up the stairs to the
third floor, also known as the Guidance Chamber.

~3F (Guidance Chamber)~

West of the entrance to this floor is a Revive. Walk east to find an old man
and listen to his story. There is a Dusk Stone north of the old man if you
walk around the stairs. There is also a hidden Ultra Ball in the rock
southeast of the Dusk Stone. Walk up the stairs the old man is standing on
and go northwest down the two sets of stairs. There is a Rare Candy waiting
for you and a Carbos hidden in the rock next to it. Push the boulder into the
hole to the south and do the same to the second boulder while your at it.
Walk up the stairs to the west and follow the path around to Cobalion.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cobalion  Lv. 42  Steel/Fighting

   Sacred Sword  Fighting  90     100       Physical
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you capture Cobalion, the old man will tell you that Terrakion and
Virizion are waiting for you. That is the end of the cave, so either use an
Escape Rope or walk back outside.

2.38.4 Rumination Field                                                [wrumi]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Rumination Field is located in Pinwheel Forest. The area leading to
Rumination Field can only be accessed after you have caught Cobalion in
Mistralton Cave.

On the main road, north of the two bridges, is an opening in the east fence.
Previously there was an old man blocking your way to the grass, but he is
gone because you have caught Cobalion. Walk into the patch of grass and east
to find two sets of stairs. Take the northern stairs and follow the path
through the hollowed-out log. There is a Hyper Potion near the stump to the
west. Continue north to find the entrance to Rumination Field. This is where
Virizion waits.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Virizion  Lv. 42  Grass/Fighting

   Sacred Sword  Fighting  90     100       Physical
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've caught Virizion, make your way back to the two sets of stairs.
This time take the narrow stairs leading south. Follow the path southeast to
find TM 22 SolarBeam. This attack deals a lot of damage, but the user takes
one turn to absorb sunlight before attacking on the second turn. If Sunny Day
is in effect, the user will absorb sunlight and attack on the same turn. Head
back and take the path west to the water. Surf west underneath the bridge
until you hit dry land again. There is a SilverPowder at the top of the
stairs. It increases the power of Bug-type moves by 20%. Hopping over the
ledge leads back to the area of Pinwheel Forest where you recovered the
Dragon Skull earlier in the game.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in this area of Pinwheel Forest:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hyper Potion      - South of the Rumination Field entrance.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Cedric will greet you and tell you about Dragonspiral Tower. Once he's done 
explaining, he will head off to the tower. The Pokemon Center is up the 
stairs to the north. The old lady inside will give you TM 31 Brick Break. It 
can remove the effects from moves like Reflect before doing damage. The old 
man by the counter will buy the Gems that you find in caves.

The Icirrus City Gym is in the northwest corner of the city. South of the gym 
is the Pokemon Fan Club. Go inside and talk to the old guy wearing a hat. If 
you show him a Pokemon that has gained between 25 to 49 levels since you 
caught it, he will give you an Exp. Share. He will give you a Cleanse Tag if 
you show him a Pokemon that has gained 50 to 98 levels. He will give you a 
King's Rock if you show him a Pokemon that has gained 99 levels. This means 
you have a level 100 Pokemon that hatched from an egg at level 1.

The house east of the gym is home to Aha, Wye, and Ditoh. They will give you 
a "Pep Quiz" once per day. The prize for answering the question correctly is 
an Antidote. You'll still get a Parlyz Heal if you answer incorrectly.

There is a house in the southeast corner of the city that is only accessible 
in the winter. Talk to the purple-haired woman inside to get a RageCandyBar. 
You can use it to battle a Darmanitan with the Zen Mode ability in the Desert 
Resort.

The only thing left to do in town is take on the gym in the northwest corner 
of the city.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Every single Pokemon in this gym is a pure Ice-type. This means they all have 
weaknesses to Fire, Fighting, Rock, and Steel while only having resistance to 
Ice.

It can save a little time if you have a Pokemon with Strength in your party. 
As you travel north to the Dragonspiral Tower, you will be stopped by Bianca.

That's all there is to do outside so enter the tower.

~1F~

Follow the path northeast to the stairs. The ground will shake as you 
approach. Travel up the stairs to the second floor.

~2F~

Take a step forward and Cheren will let you know you can walk on fallen 
columns. Walk on the west side of the fallen column in front of you and there 
will be a big boulder to push using Strength to the north. East of the big 
boulder, underneath a suspended column, is a Hyper Potion. Either use the 
fallen column on the east side of the room or use Strength on the boulder to 
get to the western doorway. There is a Stardust to pick up south of the 
stairs. Walk through the doorway.

~3F~

Walk up the stairs. This area is filled with one-way ledges. Walk down over 
the first ledge. Now there are three ledges to the left. Walk over the bottom 
one and then the next two to the left. Walk up on the following one and 
continue going up, up, right, up, and right to find a Shiny Stone. Use the 
same path this time, but go up the next set of stairs and through the doorway.

This is a psuedo-3D puzzle invloving ledges. Walk right until you find the 
stone walkway to cross. Walk left to the next walkway and cross it. There is 
a Star Piece before the ledge. Hop over the ledge and continue right until 
you hit a wall. Walk down across the two stone walkways and left to find a 
Stardust. Walk up through the two walkways again, walk left, and walk up the 
walkway to the center of the room. Go right and hop over the ledge. Walk down 
over the walkway and move left to use the next walkway down. Walk right until 
you find a Revive. Walk back to the left and use the next walkway down. Use 
the stairs to the left to enter the 6th floor.

~6F~

The ground will shake again after you take a few steps north. Follow the path 
north to find a Max Elixir. Now would be a good time to save. Walk west to 
find Giallo, another Team Plasma Sage. He will tell his four grunts to battle 
you one by one.

in Black, or Reshiram in White. The legendary Dragon-type Pokemon flys away 
and N says you will eventually meet the other one. Zekrom/Reshiram will swoop 
down and fly away with N. Cheren and Brycen appear and take you back to the

As you try to walk down the stairs into the Relic Castle, Cheren will stop 
you and say Alder is already inside. Enter the Relic Castle.

Things to know if you haven't already been here before:
-You will fall through the quicksand to the floor below if you run over the 
quicksand or walk into the center. To avoid falling through, simply walk over 
the quicksand and avoid the center.
-You can get a fossil from the female Backpacker on the first floor: Cover 
Fossil (Tirtouga) or Plume Fossil (Archen).

Walk to the west end of the room, past the Worker that previously blocked 
you, and go down the stairs.

Cheren will land after you. Alder will call you over and Ghetsis will 
essentially restate Team Plasma's goals, as if you hadn't heard them enough 
already. Ghetsis leaves and the three of you go outside. The Xtranceiver will 
eventually ring. It's Professor Juniper and she tells you to go to the 
Nacrene City Museum immediately.

Alder, Cedric, Professor Juniper, and Bianca are all standing in front of the 
museum. Lenora comes out of the musuem and reveals why Team Plasma stole the 
Dragon Skull earlier. They were actually looking for the Light Stone in order 
to resurrect the legendary Dragon-type Pokemon. She gives you the Light Stone 
and Alder tells you to go to Opelucid City because Drayden/Iris might have 
more information. Fly to Icirrus City and go to Route 8 at the southwestern 
part of town.

Strength. There is an Ultra Ball west of the boulder, on the other side of 
the lake. South of the lake is a Carbos. It increases the Speed of your

her during the day: a Damp Rock during the morning, a Heat Rock during the 
day, a Smooth Rock during the evening, and an Icy Rock during the night. Each 
rock increases the duration of its related weather effect in battle for 5 to 
8 turns when used by the Pokemon holding it. As you try to enter the Tubeline 
Bridge to the east, Bianca appears for a battle.

A baseball player will notice you once you enter Route 9. He will throw TM 59

You will be stopped by Alder and he will take you to another Team Plasma 
speech. Ghetsis talks about the same stuff as usual before leaving. Alder 
takes you to Drayden and Iris after the crowd leaves and he informs the two 
of N's plan to have the two Dragon-type legendaries battle. He then leaves 
for the Pokemon League. Drayden agrees to tell you the story of Zekrom and 
Reshiram in his house. Follow Iris to Drayden's house. They unravel the story 
behind the two Dragon-type legendaries. Afterwards, one of them (Drayden in 
Black, Iris in White) will go to the Gym and wait for you.

Walk upstairs in Drayden's house and talk to the Linebacker to receive the 
Float Stone. When held, it halves the Pokemon's weight. This can decrease 
damage taken from moves like Grass Knot. The girl at the other side of the 
table will give you the Ring Target. It nullifies any immunities that a 
Pokemon has. For example, if a Gengar holds Ring Target, it can be hit with 
Normal-type attacks. It may seem like a useless item, but using the move 
Trick can switch held items between two Pokemon which would give your 
opponent Ring Target and give you an advantage.

Walk outside and heal up at the Pokemon Center to the southeast. The house on 
the western-most street has an old man on the first floor that will give you 
a different prop every day. The house directly north of the Pokemon Center 
has a girl on the first floor that will tell you if your Pokemon have full EV 
points. Upstairs in this building is a guy who gives a Cell Battery if you 
show him a Pokemon that knows Charge that was traded from the game opposite 
of yours. The Cell Battery is a one-time use item that increases Attack if 
hit by an Electric attack.

The building to the north is the Rotation Battle House. The guy inside 
standing by the door will explain Rotation Battles if you forgot how they 
work. The trainers in this house will battle you once a day. The trainers 
have switched out their Pokemon in Pokemon White, so the male Ace Trainer has 
the three elemental monkeys. The female Ace Trainer in pigtails will battle 
you on the first floor.

Enter the building west of the Rotation Battle House and talk to the girl on 
the first floor. She will give you the Destiny Knot. When a Pokemon holding 
it is affected by Attract, it makes the opposing Pokemon fall in love too. 
The building to the west is the Pokemon Gym of Opelucid City. Enter it once 
you're ready to take on Drayden/Iris.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Opelucid City Gym features Dragon-type Pokemon. The only weakness Dragon-
type Pokemon have are against Dragon and Ice. Vanillite, Cubchoo, or one of 
their evolutions are a wonderful choice to use in this gym.

Talk to the white-haired guy at the front of the gym to get a Fresh Water. 
Walk north to battle the Ace Trainer. His Fraxure, and all Fraxures in this 
gym, have Dragon Dance. It increases Attack and Speed. If it uses Dragon Claw 
after Dragon Dance, it will do a lot of damage. It is best to take it out as 
soon as possible because it can easily take out your entire team after one or 
two Dragon Dances.

ledge and land on a switch to staighten out the neck of the third dragon. Hop 
up over the ledge on this dragon's back. Follow the path along its back and

Trainer.

Walk north and hop over the ledge and walk west to hop onto the second 
dragon's right hand. This straightens it out and raises its head to make a 
path directly to Drayden/Iris. This is a good time to save. All of the gym 
leader's Pokemon have Dragon Tail, which forces a new Pokemon out after it 
deals damage. Unfortunately, you don't get to choose the new Pokemon that is 
sent out. All of the gym leader's Pokemon are strictly Dragon-type, so Ice-
type attacks are super effective. Talk to the gym leader to initiate the 
battle.

Drayden/Iris gives you the 8th and final badge, the Legend Badge. This means 
that all Pokemon will obey you no matter what level they are. He or she also 
gives you TM 82 Dragon Tail. Use the green teleporter to return to the 
beginning of the gym and walk outside. Professor Juniper will be waiting 
outside to show you the way to Route 10 before giving you the Master Ball. It 
is a type of Poke Ball that never fails to catch a Pokemon. It is very rare 
and can't be bought, so you should save it for a very rare Pokemon. Heal up 
your Pokemon before heading off to Route 10.

The worker in the passageway to Route 10 will stop you and say there is a big 
storm on Route 7. This is the event that unlocks Tornadus in Black and 
Thundurus in White. All you have to do is go to the house east of the 
Celestial Tower on Route 7. An old woman will pull you inside and give you 
soup while talking about the legendary Pokemon. Walk outside and your 
version's legendary roaming Pokemon will swoop down and the storm will 
subside. The storm will come back and it will fly away. From now on, it is in 
the south during the morning and the north during the evening.

Victory Road is a long and difficult area of the game so make sure to stock 
up on healing items and Max Repels before going in. Also bring Pokemon with 
Surf and Strength if you want to get all items.

~1F~

Walk through the doorway leading into the rock face. This room has a set of 
stairs and some water. There is a Max Revive in the northwest corner of the 
room if you use Surf. Walk up the stairs.

~2F~

Battle the Ace Trainer near the stairs.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ace Trainer Shanta
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Whimsicott  Lv. 45  Grass
   Zebstrika   Lv. 45  Electric
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk southwest through the doorway leading outside. A Veteran will explain to 
the Ace Trainer above how to slide down the cliff. She is too scared, but you 
aren't. Walk to the east and slide down the cliff in the opening of the fence.

~1F~

Walk east to another doorway. Walk around the first body of water and Surf 
across the second to find a Rare Candy. Walk up the stairs on the west side 
of the room.

~2F~

The doorway leading back outside just leads to where you have already been so 
walk up the stairs in the northwest corner of the room.

~3F~

Battle the Ace Trainer in this room.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ace Trainer Dwayne
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Stoutland  Lv. 45  Normal
   Scolipede  Lv. 45  Bug/Poison
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk through the doorway outside. This puts you near the Ace Trainer that was 
too scared to slide down the cliff. If you walk to the east you will find an 
opening in the fence. Slide down the cliff here. TM 12 Taunt is waiting for 
you on the ledge below. It makes the opponent use only attacking moves for 3 
turns. Find your way back to the scared Ace Trainer. Enter the first doorway 
west of her and battle the Veteran inside.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Veteran Tiffany
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Beheeyem   Lv. 44  Psychic
   Heatmor    Lv. 44  Fire
   Lilligant  Lv. 44  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walking down the stairs east of Veteran Tiffany will lead to the beginning of 
Victory Road so you probably shouldn't bother unless you need to head back to 
Opelucid to heal your Pokemon. Walk up the stairs at the top of the room.

~4F~

Battle the Ace Trainer.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ace Trainer Cathy
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Simisage  Lv. 44  Grass
   Simipour  Lv. 44  Water
   Simisear  Lv. 44  Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk through the doorway leading outside and pick up the Full Restore. 
Backtrack to the Ace Trainer who is too scared to slide down the cliff and 
enter the west-most doorway near her.

~3F~

Battle the Black Belt walking around. 

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Black Belt Tyrone
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scrafty     Lv. 43  Dark/Fighting
   Mienfoo     Lv. 43  Fighting
   Conkeldurr  Lv. 43  Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk up the stairs to the east.

~4F~

Battle the Doctor at the top of the stairs.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Doctor Logan
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gothorita  Lv. 43  Psychic
   Leavanny   Lv. 43  Bug/Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He will heal your Pokemon after the battle, which is good because they have 
most likely been beat up by now. Walk up the small set of stairs west of the 
Doctor and follow the path around to the big boulder. The small rock directly 
west of the big boulder has a Revive hiding inside. Push the boulder into the 
hole and walk up the stairs on the east side of the room.

~5F~

If you want a Calcium, walk through the doorway leading outside and walk down 
the west opening of the fence. Walk through the doorway leading inside to 
find the Calcium. It increases a Pokemon's Special Attack stat. Before 
hopping over the ledge, you can walk across the bridge outside and slide down 
the cliff for an Ultra Ball. This is honestly a waste of time for the item 
you get because of the backtracking needed to get back to where you were. Hop 
down the ledge near the Doctor, walk up the stairs again, and walk up the new 
set of stairs to the sixth floor.

~6F~

There is an Ace Trainer pacing back and forth looking for a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ace Trainer David
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Klang       Lv. 44  Steel
   Darmanitan  Lv. 44  Fire
   Seismitoad  Lv. 44  Water/Ground
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Walk through the west doorway to find a Full Heal outside. Walk back inside 
and enter the east doorway this time. There are two openings in the fence 
here. Sliding down the cliff in the west opening will take you back to where 
you have already been so slide down the east opening. You will land on a 
stone walkway.

~2F:

Walk through the doorway to the east. Follow the path up the two sets of 
stairs to battle a Veteran.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Veteran Martell
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gigalith    Lv. 45  Rock
   Eelektross  Lv. 46  Electric
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the path to walk up the next set of stairs.

~7F~

The set of stairs across the room leads down to a floor you've already been 
to. If you push the big boulder into the hole and walk west, there is a new 
room that is accessible as long as you have caught Cobalion in Mistralton 
Cave. This room is where you can battle Terrakion.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Terrakion  Rock/Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   MOVE NAME     TYPE      POWER  ACCURACY  STYLE
   Helping Hand  Normal    -      -         Status
   Retaliate     Normal    70     100       Physical
   Rock Slide    Rock      75     90        Physical
   Sacred Sword  Fighting  90     100       Physical
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go back to the 7th floor and walk through the doorway leading outside. This is
the top of Victory Road. If you don't want any more items and just want to go
to the Pokemon League, walk north through this exit.

If you do want some more items, a Pokemon Ranger on this level says there is 
an item if you slide down the cliff. Slide down on the east side of him to 
find a Nugget. Walk through the doorway north of the Nugget and follow the 
path to find TM 02 Dragon Claw. This puts you back by Black Belt Tyrone. If 
you slide down the cliff on the west side of the Pokemon Ranger, you can find 
TM 93 Wild Charge. It is an Electric attack that deals recoil damage to the 
user. Make your way back to the top of Victory Road again and walk north to 
the Pokemon League.

2.52 Pokemon League                                                    [wleag]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Elite Four are some of the most difficult trainers in the game. They have 
high level Pokemon with a diverse range of moves. On top of that, you must 
defeat all four in a row without visiting a Pokemon Center to heal. This 
means you should stock up on as many Hyper Potions, Full Heals, Full 
Restores, and Revives as possible. After each battle, heal your Pokemon with 
items before taking on the next Elite Four member. Unlike previous games, you 
can battle the Unova Elite Four in any order you wish.

If you are having trouble with the Elite Four, you can do two things: level 
up your Pokemon and diversify their move sets. For example, here is the team 
I used to defeat the Elite Four:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   My Current Team
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Samurott              Simisear
   Lv. 60                Lv. 60
   Slash     Normal      Flame Burst  Fire
   Megahorn  Bug         Rock Smash   Fighting
   Surf      Water       Grass Knot   Grass
   Aqua Jet  Water       Bite         Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of my Pokemon have a surprise attack: Megahorn for Samurott and Grass 
Knot for Simisear. Each move is super effective against their main weakness 
which makes them a threat to any Pokemon they face. They are also 8-10 levels 
higher than all of the Elite Four's Pokemon. I also had four low level 
Pokemon to use as decoys while I revived and healed Samurott or Simisear 
during battle. The best Pokemon to use for this purpose is Roggenrola because 
he has the Sturdy ability, which doesn't allow it to be knocked out in one 
hit.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Elite Four Shauntal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cofagrigus  Lv. 48  Ghost
   Jellicent   Lv. 48  Water/Ghost
   Golurk      Lv. 48  Ground/Ghost
   Chandelure  Lv. 50  Ghost/Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shauntal specializes in Ghost-type Pokemon. All of her Pokemon are weak to
Ghost and Dark moves, but aren't affected by Normal or Fighting moves. Her
Pokemon have resistance to Poison and Bug moves. Golurk and Chandelure are
heavy hitters, while Jellicent and Cofagrigus can take a lot of damage.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Elite Four Grimsley
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Scrafty     Lv. 48  Dark/Fighting
   Liepard     Lv. 48  Dark
   Krookodile  Lv. 48  Ground/Dark
   Bisharp     Lv. 50  Dark/Steel
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grimsley focuses on Dark Pokemon. Every one of his Pokemon is weak to 
Fighting moves. They all have resistance to Psychic, Ghost, and Dark-type 
moves. Krookodile and Bisharp have high Attack so they will deal big damage, 
Liepard is very fast and will most likely attack first, and Scrafty will 
Poison your Pokemon with Poison Jab and try to outlast it with his high 
Defense and Special Defense.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Elite Four Caitlin
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Reuniclus   Lv. 48  Psychic
   Musharna    Lv. 48  Psychic
   Sigilyph    Lv. 48  Psychic/Flying
   Gothitelle  Lv. 50  Psychic
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Caitlin uses Psychic Pokemon. The only dual-type Pokemon she uses is 
Sigilyph, which is also Flying-type. All of Caitlin's Pokemon are weak to 
Ghost and Dark moves and resistant to Psychic and Fighting moves. Every one 
of her Pokemon other than Sigilyph is also weak to Bug moves. Caitlin's 
Pokemon have high Special Attack so they can deal big damage easily. 
Reuniclus and Musharna both have a lot of HP.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Elite Four Marshal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Throh       Lv. 48  Fighting
   Sawk        Lv. 48  Fighting
   Conkeldurr  Lv. 48  Fighting
   Mienshao    Lv. 50  Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marshal uses pure Fighting-type Pokemon. All of his Pokemon are weak to 
Flying and Psychic moves. They have resistance to Bug, Rock, and Dark moves. 
The main theme to Marshal's Fighting Pokemon is their huge Attack power. 
Mienshao is very fast and Conkeldurr has a lot of HP.

Once you defeat the final member, use the teleporter to go to the central 
plaza. Walk up to the statue and press A to ride it down to the lower level. 
Walk north up the three flights of stairs and enter the building.

Continue north to find N and Alder facing each other. N reveals that Alder 
lost his favorite Pokemon, which is the reason why he was traveling 
throughout Unova. N also reveals they just finished a battle that Alder lost. 
The legendary Dragon Pokemon starts responding to the stone you have and N 
orders Team Plasma's Castle to rise from the ground. N says everything will 
be decided in the castle before leaving.

Cheren appears and talks to Alder. Both Cheren and Alder tell you their 
reasons why Pokemon and humans shouldn't be separated and want you to tell N 
for them. Walk up the stairs through the hole in the wall and into the castle.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.53 N's Castle                                                        [wcast]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
~1F~

Six of the Team Plasma Sages will talk to you. Before they have a chance to 
battle you, some of the gym leaders show up and hold them off. Walk northwest 
through the two pillars. Go east and up the stairs.

~2F~

Continue east until one of the Shadow Triad appear. He shows you the room 
where you can heal your Pokemon. Do so by talking to the purple-haired woman. 
There is a Max Potion in the room east of the healing room. When you're 
ready, use the eastern stairs to go up to the next floor.

~3F~

The first room on this floor has a PC to withdraw and deposit Pokemon and 
items. The next room west has a Max Revive. The western-most room on this 
floor has a Team Plasma Grunt in the back that will transport you to the 
Pokemon League. This is very useful if you want to buy more Ultra Balls and 
Potions or to level up your Pokemon before the upcoming battle with N. The 
female Plasma Grunt west of him will give you an Ultra Ball. As you approach 
the western stairs of this floor leading up, a member of the Shadow Triad 
will appear. Walk up the stairs.

~4F~

Another member of the Shadow Triad will point out the room to the north. He 
says it was the world N was provided with. Inside are a lot of children's 
toys like a train set and a basketball. There is a Rare Candy in the middle 
of the half pipe. The next room east has a Full Restore. Walk up the eastern 
stairs to the next floor.

~5F~

This floor has a large doorway leading to N. As you try to enter the doorway, 
Ghetsis barges in and reveals his whole plan. He wants everyone to release 
their Pokemon so Team Plasma are the only people who have Pokemon. Then he 
will be able to rule the world.

Walk north until N starts speaking. Walk north again once he is done talking. 
He will meet you in the middle and notice that the second legendary Dragon 
Pokemon isn't responding to you. He challenges you to a battle and his Zekrom/
Reshiram crashes into the room. Your Light Stone or Dark Stone will activate 
and Reshiram/Zekrom will appear. You have a chance to save before battling 
Reshiram/Zekrom. Once you're ready, interact with it to initiate the battle. 

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Reshiram  Dragon/Fire  (Level 50)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   MOVE NAME     TYPE      POWER  ACCURACY  STYLE
   Dragonbreath  Dragon    60     100       Special

   Fusion Bolt   Electric  100    100       Physical
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are impatient, using your Master Ball is the easiest way to catch the 
legendary Pokemon. It isn't that hard to catch, though, so you probably 
shouldn't waste it. Capturing it is the same as any other Pokemon, just a 
little more difficult because it can do a lot of damage. Get its health as 
low as possible and give it a status effect before throwing Ultra Balls at it 
until it's caught. After catching it, you are given the opportunity to switch 
Reshiram/Zekrom into your party. N heals your Pokemon and starts a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   N
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   (Black Only)  Zekrom      Lv. 52  Dragon/Electric
   (White Only)  Reshiram    Lv. 52  Dragon/Fire
                 Carracosta  Lv. 50  Water/Rock
                 Klinklang   Lv. 50  Steel
                 Archeops    Lv. 50  Rock/Flying
                 Zoroark     Lv. 50  Dark
                 Vanilluxe   Lv. 50  Ice
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, N realizes that people must accept the ideas of others. 
Ghetsis appears and talks down to N. Cheren and Alder show up and Ghetsis 
reveals the real plan to them as well. Ghetsis challenges you to a battle in 
an attempt to eliminate you.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ghetsis
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Cofagrigus  Lv. 52  Ghost
   Bouffalant  Lv. 52  Normal
   Eelektross  Lv. 52  Electric
   Seismitoad  Lv. 52  Water/Ground
   Bisharp     Lv. 52  Dark/Steel
   Hydreigon   Lv. 54  Dark/Dragon
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alder explains to N that even though they didn't agree earlier, that doesn't 
mean they can't work together. Alder and Cheren take Ghetsis away and N 
reveals more about his personal story. It turns out that he was beginning to 
doubt his beliefs after he met you in Accumula Town and noticed your Pokemon 
actually liked you. The further you were in your journey, the more Pokemon N 
met that loved their trainers. He tells you to follow your dreams before 
bidding farewell.

Congratulations, you've completed the main story of Pokemon Black or White. 
After the credits roll, you see N fly off on his legendary Dragon Pokemon.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You will be in your room when your game is resumed after defeating N and
Ghetsis. Walk downstairs and you will meet Looker. He is from the
International Police. He came to Unova to investigate Team Plasma but your
actions have already helped disband them. Looker says the Seven Sages are
still in Unova, though. Accept his request to seek out all of the Seven
Sages. He gives you the Super Rod, which has absolutely nothing to do with
anything.

Walk outside to see Cheren and Bianca. Cheren reveals that Ghetsis escaped
thanks to the Shadow Triad. Bianca says she is planning on traveling to Black
City/White Forest. Cedric comes out of the lab and gives all three of you the
National Pokedex. It lists all 649 Pokemon. Bianca and Cheren head off in
different directions which leaves you free to do what you want. Start off by
going to Opelucid City and heading east to Route 11.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.55 Route 11                                                          [wrt11]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There is a French Backpacker at beginning of the route.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Backpacker Talon
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Croagunk  Lv. 65  Poison/Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a Hyper Potion in the grass northwest of Backpacker Talon. Continue
east on the main road to find a Pokemon Ranger on the bridge.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Thalia
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Rapidash  Lv. 64  Fire
   Mantine   Lv. 64  Water/Flying
   Cacturne  Lv. 64  Grass/Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

She gives you a Leppa Berry after battle. A held Leppa Berry will restore 10
PP of any move that reaches 0 PP in battle. It can also be used as an item to
restore 10 PP of any move outside of battle. If you have a Pokemon that knows
Waterfall (HM 05 Waterfall is located in Route 18), you can climb the
waterfall to the north. At the top, there is a hidden Max Revive between two
trees to the west and TM 50 Overheat is to the east. Overheat deals a lot of
damage, but also lowers the user's Special Attack stat by two stages. Descend
the waterfall and walk east to find a trailer. Unfortunately, there isn't
anything going on inside. Walk east of the trailer to battle another French
Backpacker.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Backpacker Corin
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Snover  Lv. 65  Grass/Ice
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is another waterfall southwest of Backpacker Corin with a Pokemon
Ranger waiting underneath the bridge.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Crofton
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Dewgong   Lv. 64  Water/Ice
   Pelipper  Lv. 64  Water/Flying
   Pinsir    Lv. 64  Bug
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He also gives a Leppa Berry after battle. There is a Protector waiting in the
northeast corner of the area. A Rhydon traded while holding a Protector will
evolve into a Rhyperior. That's everything in this route, so use the gate
east of Backpacker Corin to enter Village Bridge.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.56 Village Bridge                                                    [wvill]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The beginning of Village Bridge has three paths: north, south, and east onto
the bridge. The north path leads to a vending machine and a guy playing a
guitar.

The south path leads to a School Kid.

   Electrike  Lv. 60  Electric
   Poochyena  Lv. 60  Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

East of the school girl is Koontz. He will sing to the music if you talk to
him. More importantly, you can find Leftovers in the trash can he is standing
by. This is an amazing item. A Pokemon holding Leftovers will heal 1/16th of
its health each turn. Walk north underneath the bridge and surf to the island
to the east to find a Calcium. Back on the south side of the bridge, east of
Koontz, is an Ultra Ball. Surf east of the Ultra Ball to find a Scientist.

   Combee    Lv. 64  Bug/Flying
   Ursaring  Lv. 64  Normal
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can play a mini-game after the battle. All you have to do is go to each
of the four customers and take their order. Once you're finished, talk to
Baker Chris and tell him what the customers want. Afterwards, give each
customer their correct order. The reward for a perfect job is a Lum Berry,
which heals all status effects. This can be done once per day.

None of the houses on the west side of the bridge have anything eventful
inside. Crossing the bridge from the west, the first house on the east side
has a club called the Hip Waders. If you join and show him the Pokemon he
requests, he will give you some Dive Balls. There is a girl in the house east
of his that says she needs a new start and leaves with her Patrats. You will
find them again later. The east-most house on the bridge has a lady that will
heal your Pokemon.

That's all there is to do here, so head east through the gate to Route 12.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lacunosa Town is different from any other town in Unova because the citizens
go inside their house at night. Other than that, it is nothing special. There
are two things to do here. First, if you bring a legitimate Shaymin to the
girl on the first floor of the Pokemon Center, she will give you a Gracidea.
You can use it to switch your Shaymin between Land and Sky Forms. Second, you
can talk to the girl at the top of the stairs in the Pokemon Center. She will
tell you the team you used to beat each Gym Leader. Head to Route 13 to the
east when you're ready.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Items in Lacunosa Town:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gracidea - Show the girl on the first floor of the Pokemon Center a
              Shaymin.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Follow the route east to find a Lass.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Lass Fey
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Buneary    Lv. 63  Normal
   Snubbull   Lv. 63  Normal
   Shroomish  Lv. 63  Grass
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a Pokemon with Cut, you can get a Max Ether by cutting down the
trees. Go south to find a Youngster walking around.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Youngster Astor
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Nincada  Lv. 63  Bug/Ground
   Mothim   Lv. 63  Bug/Flying
   Metapod  Lv. 63  Bug
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

From here you can go south or west. Go south for now to find a Lass and a
Wingull. She says it lost three Grams throughout Route 13. You can get a TM
if you find them all and return them. The first Gram is to the south, but
battle the Artist standing on the bridge first.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Artist Zach
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Camerupt  Lv. 65  Fire/Ground
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first item you see to the south is a Razor Claw. The second item is Gram
2. Note: Gram 2 only appears after you talk to the Lass standing by the
Wingull. That is the end of this path, so go back to the patrolling Youngster
and take the west path down the stairs. Walk through the grass and onto the
beach to find a wonderful Fisherman to battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Fisherman Jones
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Tentacool   Lv. 63  Water/Poison
   Qwilfish    Lv. 63  Water/Poison
   Tentacruel  Lv. 63  Water/Poison
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Talk to the old man to the northeast and he will give you Gram 1. You might
notice you can Surf around the rocks here. That path north leads to the Giant
Chasm where the legendary Pokemon Kyurem can be caught. For now, walk south
to find a Fisherman. He is a classic type of Pokemon trainer, a Fisherman
that has six useless Magikarp. You can use this as an opportunity to train a
lower leveled Pokemon because his Magikarp pose no threat.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Fisherman Mick
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Magikarp  Lv. 60  Water
   Magikarp  Lv. 60  Water

   Surskit  Lv. 63  Bug/Water
   Seaking  Lv. 63  Water
   Goldeen  Lv. 63  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continue south to find another Parasol Lady. She doesn't want to battle, but
she does give you Gram 3. Now that you have all three Grams, head back to
Wingull and talk to the Lass. She gives all of the Grams to Wingull and he
flies away to deliver them. He leaves behind TM 89 U-turn. It is an attack
that switches out the user after it hits. Go back to the beach and travel
south until you find an umbrella. There is a path west here that leads to a
guy in a suit and shades who says he is a treausure hunter. He will give you
one of many items once per day.

   Up-Grade        Stick
   Thick Club
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The house to the northwest of him holds a man who will teach any starter
Pokemon of any generation a powerful move matching their type: Frenzy Plant
for Grass, Blast Burn for Fire, and Hydro Cannon for Water. Each move does
massive damage, but requires a recharge phase the turn after it hits. If you
Surf north of this house and follow the water northwest, you will eventually
find a house on the beach. This house holds a Veteran that gives away the
Splash Plate and the Draco Plate. These plates can be used to change the type
of an Arceus. He says the rest of the plates can be found in the underwater
Abyssal Ruins of Undella Bay.

Head back to the main beach. If you Surf to the east at any point on this
beach, you can find a DeepSeaScale, which increases a Clamperl's Special
Defense. A Clamperl holding a DeepSeaScale while traded will evolve into a
Gorebyss. There is also a Fisherman on a sandbar southeast of the
DeepSeaScale ready for a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Fisherman Pete
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Feebas    Lv. 63  Water
   Kingler   Lv. 63  Water
   Remoraid  Lv. 63  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head back to the main beach and travel to the south end to battle another
Fisherman.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Fisherman Vince
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Krabby     Lv. 64  Water
   Octillery  Lv. 64  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you walk along the thin path of beach east of Fisherman Vince you will
eventually find a Black Belt running around a rock.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Black Belt Benjamin
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sawk       Lv. 65  Fighting
   Hitmonlee  Lv. 65  Fighting
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Head back to Fisherman Vince and continue south to find two sets of stairs.
Use the stairs leading west to find TM 29 Psychic past a big boulder. It is a
great move for any Psychic Pokemon. It deals decent damage and has a 10%
chance of lowering the opponent's Special Defense. Go back down the stairs
and use the other set of stairs to the east. There is a tree to the south
that can be cut down. The new path leads to an Electirizer. An Electabuzz
will evolve into an Electivire when traded if it is holding an Electirizer.
Continue east on the main path to battle a set of Twins.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Twins Emy & Lin
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Gentleman Yan
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Farfetch'd  Lv. 64  Grass
   Granbull    Lv. 64  Normal

   Socialite Marian
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Kricketot  Lv. 64  Bug
   Chimecho   Lv. 64  Psychic
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gate to the southeast leads to Undella Town. First, you might want to go
to the Giant Chasm and catch Kyurem. Head back to the old man who gave you
Gram 1. Surf past the rocks northeast of him to a set of stairs. There is a
Prism Scale by the stairs. It evolves a Feebas into Milotic when traded. At
the top of the stairs, push the big boulder into the hole for easier access
to the Giant Chasm in the future. Continue north to the Giant Chasm.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Bring a Pokemon with Strength to the Giant Chasm. Go west down the stairs to
the cave entrance. Going clockwise around the perimeter of the cave, you can
find a Star Piece, another Star Piece, and a Comet Shard. The Comet Shard can
be sold in Icirrus City. You can also find TinyMushrooms and Big Mushrooms
throughout the cave hiding in rocks. Go to the southeast corner of the cave
and you will find a big boulder. Push it into the hole using Strength. Follow
the dirt path west but don't hop over the ledge to the south. Instead, go
down the stairs to the west and you will be right by the exit. Walk through
the exit to find yourself in another forest area.

There is a Max Elixir to the west. Go north to find a Max Potion. There is a
north-facing ledge west of the Max Potion you need to hop over. Northeast of
this ledge is a Revive near the rock face. There is a Carbos southeast of the
Revive. Travel east of the Carbos to find two ledges facing east. Don't use
the top ledge. Instead, you can find TM 13 Ice Beam before the bottom of the
two ledges. Ice Beam is a solid Ice-type attack that has a 10% chance of
freezing the opponent. Southeast of the two ledges is a Full Heal. Continue
to the southeast corner of the area to find a Max Revive. In some grass
northwest of the Max Revive is TM 03 Psyshock. Do not use the ledge southwest
of TM 03 Psyshock because it will lead back to the beginning of the area.
Instead, go northwest of TM 03 Psyshock to find a north-facing ledge. Hop
over the ledge and go east, then south through the path between the trees.
You will find a pond that seems like it has evaporated. You will hear a
Pokemon cry as you approach the pond and a blizzard will start. All of the
trees and rocks will disappear leaving only snow. Go north and use the
entrance to the next cave. This is the cave where Kyurem waits.

Enter the Pokemon Center and talk to the man standing inside. He will give
you a Prism Scale. Now head back outside and talk to the girl southwest of
the Pokemon Center. She will give you HM 06 Dive. It allows you to Dive down
into dark patches of water in the sea. Walk into the house north of her to
meet Cynthia from the Sinnoh region. She is looking for a battle. You can
battle her if you wish, but be warned that her Pokemon are very tough.

during the Spring. The other two houses to the west are empty if it isn't
Summer. If it is Summer, the western-most house has a man inside that wants
to trade his Munchlax for your Cinccino. Continue west to find the big villa
belonging to the Riches. A Big Nugget can be found northeast of the big
villa. Talk to the boy south of the big villa for a quick battle.

water's surface. Use Dive on any of the dark spots in the water to go to the
Abyssal Ruins.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Abyssal Ruins are made up of four floors. The first floor contains plates
that can be used to change the type of Arceus. All floors contain relic items
that can be sold to the guy dressed up as a Black Belt in Undella Town's big
villa.

As you travel through the Abyssal Ruins, you will notice messages about a
noise after a certain amount of steps. The noise will keep getting louder
until you are carried away by a torrent of water after about 500 steps. To
get to the second floor, you must get to the central purple block on the
first floor and interact with it before you take 190 steps. The purple block
on the second floor requires you use Flash. The purple block on the third
floor requires you use Strength. In the end, the only worthwhile items in the
Abyssal Ruins are the plates on the first floor. All of the relic items have
no purpose other than to be sold in Undella Town.

2.66 Black City                                                        [wblac]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Black City is exclusive to Pokemon Black. The first time you enter the city,
it will most likely have nothing other than a Pokemon Center. You need to use
the Entralink in order to visit someone else's White Forest and invite
trainers to Black City. This will populate Black City with trainers that you
can battle.

You can access the Entralink by choosing "Wireless" in your C-Gear and then
choosing "Entralink" to warp there. On the east and west ends of the
Entralink are bridges. Each of the two bridges have an aura-like barrier. In
order to pass through the barrier you need to connect with someone locally,
not over WiFi, who is in their own Entralink at the same time. Once this
happens, pass through the barrier on the bridge, go to their White Forest,
and talk to the residents there. Keep talking to people until you eventually
find someone who you can invite to Black City. That is all you have to do in
order to populate Black City.

Each trainer that comes to Black City can be battled. There is also a
marketplace that appears after there are a certain number of trainers in
Black City. The specific trainers that populate Black City affect the items
that are sold in the marketplace. Here is a list of trainers, their Pokemon,

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
White Forest is exclusive to Pokemon White. Pokemon from previous generations
can be found in White Forest that can't be found anywhere else in Unova or
Pokemon Black. In order to start catching these Pokemon, you need to invite
people from someone else's Black City using the Entralink.

You can access the Entralink by choosing "Wireless" in your C-Gear and then
choosing "Entralink" to warp there. On the east and west ends of the
Entralink are bridges. Each of the two bridges have an aura-like barrier. In
order to pass through the barrier you need to connect with someone locally,
not over WiFi, who is in their own Entralink at the same time. Once this
happens, pass through the barrier on the bridge, go to their Black City, and
talk to the residents there. Keep talking to people until you eventually find
someone who you can invite to White Forest. That is all you have to do in
order to populate White Forest.

Each trainer that populates White Forest enables you to encounter a specific
Pokemon in the grass. Here is a list of Pokemon available in White Forest and
their associated trainer(s):

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Bring a Pokemon with Strength if you want to explore all of Route 15. Head
down the stairs to the south to find a big boulder. Push it south three
times, east once, south once, and east one more time to push it into its
hole. Walk over the boulder to find an Up-Grade. A Porygon holding an Up
Grade when traded will evolve into a Porygon2. Walk northwest to battle a
Pokemon Ranger.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Keith
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Marowak    Lv. 65  Ground
   Exeggutor  Lv. 65  Grass/Psychic
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He gives you a Sitrus Berry after battle. There is a boulder northwest of
Pokemon Ranger Keith. Push it west three times, north twice, and east once to
put it into its hole. Walk up the stairs to the north into a patch of dark
grass holding TM 09 Venoshock. Venoshock is a Poison-type attack that does
double damage if the target is already poisoned. Further west of Pokemon
Ranger Keith is a Battle Girl.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Battle Girl Susie
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Meditite   Lv. 64  Fighting/Psychic
   Hitmontop  Lv. 64  Fighting
   Medicham   Lv. 64  Fighting/Psychic
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

is a hidden Max Revive at the end of this chasm. Hop down the ledge west of
Battle Girl Susie to battle a female Pokemon Ranger.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pokemon Ranger Shelly
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Altaria    Lv. 65  Dragon/Flying
   Abomasnow  Lv. 65  Grass/Ice
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

She also gives away a Sitrus Berry after battle. There are two ledges east of
her. In between them is a hidden Ultra Ball in the big rock. Walk up the
stairs west of Pokemon Ranger Shelly to battle a PokeFan.

   Swablu    Lv. 62  Normal/Flying
   Spheal    Lv. 62  Ice/Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the trailer to the north is Lillian. She wants to trade her Rotom for your
Ditto. You can catch Dittos back in the Giant Chasm if you want to trade with
her. This is the only place you can get a Rotom in Black or White so it is a
nice trade. Use the stairs east of the trailer to find the PokeTransfer Lab.
It can be used to transfer your Pokemon from Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heart
Gold, and Soul Silver to your Pokemon Black or White game. When you enter, a
Scientist will greet you and notice you have all eight gym badges. She will
lead you to Professor Park, an eccentric scientist who is dying to find a
trainer to test out his machine. He sort of explains how the PokeTransfer
works and will allow you to use it whenever you want from now on.

West of the PokeTransfer Lab is the last trainer to battle on Route 15, an
Italian Hiker.

2.69 Marvelous Bridge                                                  [wmarv]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There is an Ace Trainer in the gate between Route 15 and Marvelous Bridge who
wants to have a triple battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ace Trainer Glinda
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Beheeyem   Lv. 65  Psychic
   Klinklang  Lv. 65  Steel
   Alomomola  Lv. 65  Water
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

As long as you talked to her back in Village Bridge, the girl with the four
Patrats is on the western end of Marvelous Bridge. She will let you play a
game with her once a day. The game is simple, you must follow the Patrat
holding a Big Mushroom while all four Patrats dance around in a line. The
prize for choosing the correct Patrat is the Big Mushroom it is holding.

As you walk into the center of the bridge, the Shadow Triad appear. They
reveal that Ghetsis saved their lives at one point and they are loyal to him
for it. They give you an Adamant Orb, a Lustrous Orb, and a Griseous Orb. The
Adamant Orb powers up Dialga's Dragon and Steel-type moves, the Lustrous Orb
powers up Palkia's Dragon and Water-type moves, and the Griseous Orb powers
up Giratina's Dragon and Ghost-type moves.

There is a man on the west end of the bridge that will sell you a Magikarp
for $500 as long as you have a spare slot in your party. Why wouldn't you buy
one? Magikarps are awesome!

The Marvelous bridge connects to Route 16, which you should have already
explored by this point in the game. Don't worry, though, because there are
still more areas that have opened up since you defeated the Elite Four.

From the Dreamyard entrance, walk east past the girl who gave you the
elemental monkey and then northeast to find a tiny opening between a wall and
a barrel. You may remember that an orange traffic cone blocked the way before
you defeated the Elite Four. Continue east to walk down a set of stairs to
the basement of the Dreamyard.

~BASEMENT~

Unlike most areas, the patrolling trainers in the Dreamyard basement will

Continue east and walk up the stairs back outside.

~OUTSIDE~

Northwest is a Revive. Walk south to find Team Plasma Sage Gorm. He gives you
TM 75 Swords Dance. It is a move that greatly increases a Pokemon's Attack
stat. Looker shows up and takes Gorm away for questioning. Walk west through
the grass to eventually find a set of stairs. On the other side of the west
wall is a Hyper Potion. Take the stairs back down to the basement and walk
north to find TM 85 Dream Eater. Dream Eater only hits sleeping Pokemon and
the user replenishes his or her health equal to 50% of the damage dealt.
North of the stairs is a boulder that can be pushed into its hole to make a
path back to the beginning of the Dreamyard.

2.71 Relic Castle Post Game                                            [wrelp]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Professor Juniper will pop out of the Relic Castle as you try to enter.
She'll explain her research of the statues, which turn out to be Darmanitan.
She gives you a RageCandyBar which will wake one up for a battle. Go ahead
and wake one up if you want to catch a Darmanitan with the Zen Mode ability.
Either way, go into the Relic Castle and make your way to the 5th basement
floor. It is the floor with the big set of stairs in the northwest corner and
a small doorway in the northeast corner.

Use the small doorway in the northeast corner of the 5th basement floor and
walk north until you find a Team Plasma Grunt. He is surprised to see you so
he runs west down the stairs. Follow him to the next room for a battle.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Team Plasma Grunt
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Krookodile  Lv. 64  Ground/Dark
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

He tells you Plasma Sage Ryoku is looking for something in the Relic Castle.
This portion of the Relic Castle is somewhat of a maze. Don't worry, though,
because there are only two places you need to go, both of which are very east
to find. The first room you want to find holds Ryoku. To get there from the
first room that had the battle with the Plasma Grunt go down, left, down,
left, and left. Talk to Ryoku in this room and he will give you TM 04 Calm
Mind. Looker will eventually take him away for questioning. The doorway Ryoku
was standing in front of holds Volcarona. It is the evolution of Larvesta,
which hatches from the egg you got on Route 18.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Volcarona  Lv. 70  Bug/Fire
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   MOVE NAME     TYPE  POWER  ACCURACY  STYLE

   Heat Wave     Fire  100    90        Status
   Bug Buzz      Bug   90     100       Special
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next room you want to find leads to another TM. From the room Ryoku was
in go left, left, up, left, up, and left. Alternatively, you can get to this
room from the first room with the Plasma Grunt battle by continuously going
left. Either way, this room has a huge set of stairs. Walk up the stairs and
go north through the doorway. There are going to be a total of six sets of
stairs to walk up. At the top of the stairs is TM 26 Earthquake. That is
everything in Relic Castle so you can hop over the ledge and go outside.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Challenger's Cave is located on the south end of Route 9. A Black Belt guards
it and he will only let you enter after you have defeated the Elite Four for
the first time. Bring Pokemon that know Flash and Surf if you want to explore
the entire cave.

The first thing to do is use Flash so you can see. There is a Backpacker to
the north ready for a battle.

southern-most part of Ace Trainer Beverly's patrol and walk west through the
two rocks to find a set of stairs leading down a floor.

~B2F~

Walk north to the water and Surf east until the water ends. Here you can go

Continue on the path until you find a big set of stairs going west. East of
these stairs is a Timer Ball. Go up the stairs and cross the long bridge over

middle of the path. Follow the path northeast to find a Veteran by the water.

Surfing north of Veteran Julia leads to an Oval Stone. Surfing east of her
leads to a Black Belt. It powers up Fighting-type moves by 20% when held.
There is also a hidden Heart Scale in the middle of the rock in the water
east of her. Walk down the stairs west of Veteran Julia to find a hidden Rare
Candy inside a rock. Northwest of the Rare Candy is a Protein. Northeast of
the Protein is TM 71 Stone Edge. Hop over the ledge to the north and take the
stairs back to the first basement floor. That's everything in Challenger's
Cave so head back outside.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Royal Unova is a ship located on the dock near the Pokemon Center in
Castelia City. It only sets sail once a day at specific times.

Spring  17:00 - 19:59
Summer  19:00 - 20:59
Autumn  17:00 - 19:59
Winter  16:00 - 18:59

There are quite a few trainers to battle in the ship but only some of them
can be battled on certain days. You get a prize if you defeat all available
trainers but there's a catch. There is only a certain amount of time you can
stay on the ship before they kick you off so you have to battle all of the
available trainers quickly if you want the prize. You win a Lava Cookie on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Berry Juice on Tuesday, an Old Gateau on
Thursday, a RageCandyBar on Saturday, and a Rare Candy on Sunday. The only
worthwhile prize is the Rare Candy on Sundays but the experience you receive
from the battles always makes the ride worth it.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Anville Town is accessible through the Battle Subway in Nimbasa City. It is
most exciting during the weekends. That's when there are more people waiting
around to trade items with you. The most useful trade is with a Clerk that
will trade his PP Ups for your Star Pieces. There is also a female Ace
Trainer who will give you a Full Restore for 20 Poke Balls and a male
Backpacker who will trade a Revive for any Escape Ropes you have. The officer

After you defeat the Elite Four for the first time, Cheren can be found on
Route 5 where you first met Alder. After talking to him, he will be waiting
at the top of Victory Road. Fly to the Pokemon League and walk south to
Victory Road. He is inside the doorway to the right. Talk to Cheren. Marshal
will eventually show up to impart some knowledge on behalf of Alder. Marshal
leaves and Cheren is ready to battle.

2.78 Elite Four Rematch                                                [we4re]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The second time you face the Elite Four is the ultimate test of Pokemon Black
and White. As hard as it may have been the first time, the second time is
much more difficult. The main difference is that all Pokemon are now above
level 70. Also, each Elite Four member has two more Pokemon on their team,
both from a previous generation. Their other four Pokemon have the same moves
as the first time you battled them. Finally, you must battle Champion Alder
after you defeat the Elite Four. This is a difficult task, but having a
balanced team with a smart moveset makes it much easier. Keep in mind that a
lot of the Elite Four Pokemon have sneaky attacks that will counter their
weaknesses so you shouldn't ever feel safe even if your Pokemon has a type
advantage over their active Pokemon.

Make sure to stock up on Revives and healing items before taking on the Elite
Four for the second time. Chances are your Pokemon will take a lot of damage
and most likely get knocked out throughout the five battles ahead.
Specifically, I suggest taking Revives, Hyper Potions, and Full Heals.

Pokemon have resistance to Poison and Bug moves. Shauntal's new Pokemon are
Froslass and Drifblim. Froslass doesn't have any traits that are terribly out

are weak to Fire-type moves. All of her Pokemon have a resistance to Psychic-
type moves. Bronzong knows the Electric-type attack Charge Beam and Metagross
knows the Ground-type move Earthquake. Bronzong has very good Defense and
Special Defense so it can take quite a few hits before going down. Metagross
has good physical Attack and Defense.

Walk north up the stairs to enter the building where Alder is waiting.

Alder doesn't focus on a single type of Pokemon. Instead, he uses a variety
of different types. Accelgor, Vanilluxe, and Escavalier are all weak to Fire
type attacks and none of them have any moves to counter Fire-type Pokemon, so
a heavy hitting Fire-type can easily take out half of his team. Alder's most
powerful Pokemon is Bouffalant. He has a diverse moveset, knowing Head Charge
(Normal), Megahorn (Bug), Stone Edge (Rock), and Earthquake (Ground). On top
of that, his ability is Sap Sipper. When he is hit by a Grass-type move, the
attack does no damage and Bouffalant's Attack stat raises because of Sap
Sipper.

After defeating Alder, he will take you to another room with a machine that
will record your team. The game will save and the credits will roll once
again. Congratulations, you've made it all the way through Pokemon Black or
White. Unfortunately, that is the end of the game. Remember you can always
battle other people online, go to the Battle Subway, ride the Royal Unova,
rebattle the Elite Four, and do many other things over again throughout
Unova. I hope you found this guide useful.

This guide is the product of my own research/playthrough. I used these
websites as confirmation for items, trainers, etc. while playing through the
Japanese version of the game:

http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/
http://www.serebii.net/
http://www.marriland.com/

All of these websites are great. If my guide doesn't help you, you will
undoubtedly be able to get help at one of those websites.
